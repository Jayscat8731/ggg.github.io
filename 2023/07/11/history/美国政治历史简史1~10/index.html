<h2 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h2><p>Hi I’m John Green, and this is Crash Course U.S. History!</p>
<p>No, Stan. That’s not gonna work, actually.</p>
<p>I mean, we’re talking about the 16th century today,when this was neither united nor states.</p>
<p>By the way, this globe reflects the fact that I believe that Alaskan statehood is illegitimate!</p>
<p>In fact, we’re going to call this whole show “U.S. History”</p>
<p>but inevitably it is going to involve other parts of the world and also, not to brag, a small part of the moon.</p>
<p>Sorry, we can be a little bit self-aggrandizing sometimes, here in America.</p>
<p>So to begin U.S. history, we’re not going to talk about the United states or this guy.</p>
<p>We’re going to talk about the people who lived here before any Europeans showed up.</p>
<p>North America was home to a great variety of people so it’s difficult to generalize, but here’s what we can say:</p>
<p>One, when the Europeans arrived there were no classical-style civilizations with monumental architecture and empires like the Aztec or the Incas.</p>
<p>And two, native North Americans had no metalwork, no gun powder, no wheels, no written languages, and no domesticated animals.</p>
<p>However, they did have farming, complex social and political structures, and widespread trade networks.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Green! Mr. Green! So they were pretty backwards, huh? Well, or I mean at least primitive.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Primitive” is a funny word, me from the past, because it implies a romanticization –</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>these simple people who never used more than they needed and had no use for guns. And it also implies an infantilization. It’s like you believe just because you have a beeper and they didn’t they were somehow less-evolved humans. But you can’t see the human story as one that goes from primitive to civilized. That’s not just Eurocentric that’s contemporary-centric. The idea that we’re moving forward as a species implies a linear progression that just does not reflect the reality of life on this planet. I get that you like to imagine yourself as the result of millennia of advancement and the very pinnacle of human-ness, but from where I’m sitting that worldview is a lot more backwards than living without the wheel. So no one knows exactly how many people lived in North America before the Europeans got here. Some estimates are as high as 75 million, but in the present US borders the guesses are between 2 and 10 million. And like other Native Americans their populations were decimated by diseases such as smallpox and influenza. Actually it was much worse than decimation. As many of you have pointed out, “decimation” means 1 in 10. This was much worse than that. It was closer maybe to 8 in 10, which would be an “octicimation.” So there had been civilizations in North America but they peaked before the Europeans arrived. The Zuni and Hopi civilization roundabout here peaked</p>
<p>about 1200 CE. </p>
<p>They had large, multiple-family dwellings and canyons, which they probably left because of drought. Crash Course World History fans will remember that environmental degradation often causes the decline of civilizations. I’m looking at you, Indus Valley, and also you, entire future Earth. Eut complex civilizations weren’t the rule in North America. And now we’re about to begin generalizing, a bad habit historians have partly because there’s a limited historical record but also because Eurocentric historians have a bad habit of primitivizing and simplifying others. So I want to underscore that there was huge diversity in the pre-Columbus American experience and that talking about someone who lived here in 1000 BCE and talking about someone who lived here 2,000 years later is just inherently problematic.  </p>
<p>That said, let’s go to the Thought Bubble: Most native groups in most places organized as tribes, and their lives were dominated by the natural resources available where they lived. So West Coast Indians primarily lived by fishing, gathering, and hunting sea mammals; Great Plains Indians were often buffalo hunters. These tribal bands often united into loose confederacies or leagues, the best-known of which was probably the Iroquois Confederacy, also called the Great League of Peace. This was kind of like an upstate New York version of NATO but without a nuclear weapons or the incessant international meddling or Latvians– Okay, it was nothing like NATO, actually. Religion usually involved a vibrant spiritual world with ceremonies geared toward the tribe’s lifestyle: hunting tribes focused on animals, agricultural tribes on good harvests. And most Indian groups believed in a single creator god who stood above all the other deities, but they weren’t monotheistic in the way that Christians who came to the New World were. American Indians also saw property very differently from Europeans. To First Peoples, land was a common resource that village leaders could assign families to use but not to own, and most land was seen as common to everyone. As Blackhawk, a leader of the Sauk tribe, said, “The Great Spirit gave it to his children to</p>
<p>live upon and cultivate as far as necessary for their subsistence; and so long as they occupy and cultivate it, they have a right to the soil.”</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble. Many of us tend to romanticize American Indians as being immune from greed and class, but in fact there were class distinctions in Indian tribes. Rulers tended to come from the same families, for instance. That said, wealth was much more evenly distributed than it was in Europe. And while most tribal leaders were men, many tribes were matrilineal meaning that children became members of their mother’s family. Also women were often important religious leaders. Women also often owned dwellings and tools, although not land because again that idea did not exist. Also in many tribes women engaging in premarital skoodilypooping wasn’t taboo. In general they were just much less obsessed with female chastity than Europeans were. I mean I will remind you the first English settlement in America was called “Virginia.” The idea that Native Americans were noble savages, somehow purer than Europeans and untouched by their vices is not a new one. Like some of the earliest European saw the Indians as paragons of physical beauty and innocent of Europeans’ worst characteristics. But for most Europeans there was little noble about what they saw as pure Indian savagery. I mean Indians didn’t have writing, they suffered from the terrible character flaw of being able to have sex without feeling ashamed, and most importantly they weren’t Christians. The Spanish were the first Europeans to explore this part of the world. Juan Ponce de León arrived in what is now Florida in 1513 looking for gold and the fabled Fountain of Youth. In 1521 he encountered a Calusa brave’s poison-tipped arrow and died before discovering that the Fountain of Youth is of course delicious Diet Dr. Pepper. Mmm, ahh. I can taste all 23 flavors. There were many more Spanish explorers in the first half of the 16th century including one Álvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, who wandered through the American Southwest looking for gold, which I mentioned entirely because I think that guy’s last name means “cow head.” Of course none of these people found any gold, but they did make later European colonization easier by bringing over the microbes that wiped out most native populations. So the Spanish wanted to colonize Florida to set up military bases to thwart the pirates who preyed on silver-laden Spanish galleons coming out of México. But Spanish missionaries also came over hoping to convert local native populations. This of course worked out magnificently. Just kidding, it went terribly. Many of the missions were destroyed by an uprising of Guale Indians in 1597, and I will remind you mispronouncing things is my thing. In general colonizing Florida sucked because it was hot and mosquito-y. Spain was much more successful at colonizing the American Southwest. In 1610 Spain established its first permanent settlement in the southwest at Santa Fe, New México. You couldn’t really say that it flourished since Santa Fe’s population never got much above 3,000, but it had a great small-town feel. New México is really important because it’s the site of the first large-scale uprising by Native Americans against Europeans. I mean the native people, who the Spanish called “Pueblos,” had seen their fortunes decline significantly since the arrival of Europeans. How much decline? Well, between 1600 and 1680 their population went from about 60,000 to about 17,000. Also the Franciscan friars who came to convert the indigenous people became increasingly militant about stamping out all native religion. The Spanish Inquisition just wasn’t very keen on the kind of cultural blending that made early conversion efforts successful. So while the Spanish saw all the Pueblos as one people they also knew there were tribal differences that made it difficult for the Indians to unite and rise up against the Spanish. But nothing unites like a common enemy, and in 1680 a religious leader named Popé organized an uprising to drive the Spaniards out. Popé organized about 2,000 warriors, who killed 400 Spanish colonists and forced the rest to leave Santa Fe. So the Spanish colony in New México was effectively destroyed. The Pueblos tore down all the Christian churches and replaced them with kivas (their places of worship), but like most awesome uprisings it didn’t last. After the revolt the Spanish were much more tolerant of indigenous religion, and they also abandoned the forced labor practice called encomienda. Oh, it’s time for the new Crash Course feature the “Mystery Document”? How mysterious. The rules here are simple: I read an attempt to identify the mystery document. If I am right, I do not get shocked by this shock pen. And if I am wrong, I do. Okay, what do we have here? “The Indians were totally deprived of their freedom and were put in the harshest, fiercest most horrible servitude and captivity which no one who has not seen it can understand. Even beasts enjoy more freedom when they are allowed to graze in the fields. But our Spaniards gave no such opportunity to Indians and truly considered them perpetual slaves. I sometimes came upon dead bodies on my way, and upon others who were grasping and moaning in their death agony repeating, ‘Hungry, hungry.’ Andthis was the freedom, the good treatment and the Christianity the Indians received.” Well, that’s nice. Okay, so the mystery document is always a primary source, and since the writer refers to “our Spaniards” I’m going to guess that he or she (probably he) is European and a Spaniards sympathetic to the Indians, which narrows the list of suspects considerably. So it probably wasn’t de Sepúlveda for instance, who argued that the Indians might not even be human. Okay, Stan I’m actually pretty confident here. I believe it is from “A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies” by Bartolomé de las Casas. Ah, dang it! Stan just told me I have the author right but the book wrong. It’s “A History of the Indies.” Oh, I hate shocks, both literal and metaphorical. So we focused a lot on the brutality of the Spanish toward the Indians, but at least one Spaniard, de las Casas, recognized that his countrymen were terrible. This realization is a good thing, obviously, but it leads us to one of the big problems when it comes to studying this time and place. The Black Legend is the tale that the Spanish unleashed unspeakable cruelty on the Indians. Now, that tale is true.  But that idea was used by later settlers, especially the English, to justify their own settlements. Like part of the reason they needed to expand their empire was to save the Indians from the awful Spanish, but were the English so much better? Yeah, probably not. As we mentioned at the beginning of today’s episode, American Indians didn’t have writing so we don’t have records of their perspective. Now, some Europeans like de las Casas were critical of the Spaniards, but most considered the Indians heathens and implied or even outright said that they deserved whatever horrible things befell them. So at the beginning of our series I want to point out something that we need to remember throughout: One of the great things about American history is that we have a lot of written sources. This is the advantage of the U.S. coming onto the scene so late in the game, historically speaking, But every story we hear comes from a certain point of view. And we always need to remember who is speaking, why they are speaking, and especially which voices go unheard and why. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week. </p>
<h1 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h1><p>Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course US History,</p>
<p>and today we’re going to tell the story of how a group of plucky English people struck a blow for religious freedom,</p>
<p>and founded the greatest, freest and fattest nation the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>[Libertage]</p>
<p>These Brits entered a barren land containing no people,</p>
<p>and quickly invented the automobile, baseball and Star Trek and we all lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>Mr. Green, Mr. Green, if it is really that simple, I am so getting an A in this class.</p>
<p>Oh, me from the past, you’re just a delight.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So most Americans grew up hearing that the United States was founded by pasty English people</p>
<p>who came here to escape religious persecution.</p>
<p>And that’s true of the small proportion of people who settled in the Massachusetts Bay</p>
<p>and created what we now know is New England.</p>
<p>But these Pilgrims and Puritans, there’s a difference, weren’t the first people</p>
<p>or even the first Europeans to come to the only part of the globe we didn’t paint over.</p>
<p>In fact they weren’t the first English people.</p>
<p>The first English people came to Virginia.</p>
<p>Off topic but how weird is it that the first permanent English colony in the Americas was named</p>
<p>not for Queen Elizabeth’s epicness but for her supposed chastity.</p>
<p>Right anyway, those first English settlers weren’t looking for religious freedom, they wanted to get rich.</p>
<p>So the first successful English colony in America was founded in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.</p>
<p>I say “successful” because there were two previous attempts to colonize the region.</p>
<p>They were both epic failures.</p>
<p>The more famous of which was the colony of Roanoke Island set up by Sir Walter Raleigh,</p>
<p>which is famous because all the colonists disappeared leaving only the word “Croatoan” on carved into a tree.</p>
<p>Jamestown was a project of the Virginia Company,</p>
<p>which existed to make money for its investors, something it never did.</p>
<p>The hope was that they would find gold in the Chesapeake region like the Spanish had in South America,</p>
<p>so there were a disproportionate number of goldsmiths</p>
<p>and jewelers there to fancy up that gold which of course did not exist.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that jewelers dislike farming –</p>
<p>so much so, that Captain John Smith who soon took over control of the island once said</p>
<p>that they would rather starve than farm.</p>
<p>So in the first year, half of the colonists died.</p>
<p>400 replacements came, but, by 1610, after a gruesome winter called “The Starving Time,”</p>
<p>the number of colonists had dwindled to 65.</p>
<p>And eventually word got out that the new world’s 1 year survival rate was</p>
<p>like 20% and it became harder to find new colonists.</p>
<p>But 1618, a Virginia company hit upon a recruiting strategy called the headright system</p>
<p>which offered 50 acres of land for each person that a settler paid to bring over.</p>
<p>And this enabled the creation of a number of large estates,</p>
<p>which were mostly worked on and populated by indentured servants.</p>
<p>Indentured servants weren’t quite slaves, but they were kind of temporary slaves.</p>
<p>Like they could be bought and sold and they had to do what their masters commanded.</p>
<p>But after seven to ten years of that, if they weren’t dead,</p>
<p>they were paid their freedom dues which they hoped would allow them to buy farms of their own.</p>
<p>Sometimes that worked out, but often either the money wasn’t enough to buy a farm,</p>
<p>or else they were too dead to collect it.</p>
<p>Even more ominously in 1619, just 12 years after the founding of Jamestown,</p>
<p>the first shipment of African slaves arrived in Virginia.</p>
<p>So the colony probably would have continued to struggle along,</p>
<p>if they hadn’t found something that people really loved: tobacco.</p>
<p>Tobacco had been grown in Mexico since at least 1000 BCE,</p>
<p>but the Europeans had never seen it and it proved to be kind of a</p>
<p>“thank you for the small pox; here’s some lung cancer” gift from the natives.</p>
<p>Interestingly King James hated smoking.</p>
<p>He called it “a custom loathsome to the eye and hateful to the nose”</p>
<p>but he loved him some tax revenue, and nothing sells like drugs.</p>
<p>By 1624 Virginia was producing more than 200,000 pounds of tobacco per year.</p>
<p>By the 1680s, more than 30 million pounds per year.</p>
<p>Tobacco was so profitable the colonists created huge plantations with very little in the way of towns</p>
<p>or infrastructure to hold the social order together, a strategy that always works out brilliantly.</p>
<p>The industry also structured Virginian society.</p>
<p>First off, most of the people who came in the 17th century, three-quarters of them, were servants.</p>
<p>So Virginia became a microcosm of England:</p>
<p>a small class of wealthy landowners sitting atop a mass of servants.</p>
<p>That sounds kind of dirty but it was mostly just sad.</p>
<p>The society was also overwhelmingly male, because male servants were more useful in the tobacco fields,</p>
<p>they were the greatest proportion of immigrants.</p>
<p>In fact they outnumbered women 5 to 1.</p>
<p>The women who did come over were mostly indentured servants,</p>
<p>and if they were to marry, which they often did because they were in great demand,</p>
<p>they had to wait until their term of service was up.</p>
<p>This meant delayed marriage which meant fewer children which further reduced the number of females.</p>
<p>Life was pretty tough for these women, but on the upside Virginia was kind of a swamp of pestilence,</p>
<p>so their husbands often died, and that created a small class of widows or even unmarried women who,</p>
<p>because of their special status, could make contracts and own property, so that was good, sort of.</p>
<p>OK. A quick word about Maryland.</p>
<p>Maryland was the second Chesapeake Colony, founded in 1632,</p>
<p>and by now there was no messing around with joint stock companies.</p>
<p>Maryland was a proprietorship: a massive land grant to a single individual named Cecilius Calvert.</p>
<p>Calvert wanted to turn Maryland into like a medieval feudal kingdom to benefit himself and his family,</p>
<p>and he was no fan of the representational institutions that were developing in Virginia.</p>
<p>Also Calvert was Catholic, and Catholics were welcome in Maryland which wasn’t always the case elsewhere.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, let’s talk about Massachusetts.</p>
<p>So Jamestown might have been the first English colony, but Massachusetts Bay is probably better known.</p>
<p>This is largely because the colonists who came there were so recognizable for their beliefs and also for their hats.</p>
<p>That’s right. I’m talking about the Pilgrims and the Puritans.</p>
<p>And no, I will not be talking about Thanksgiving</p>
<p>…is a lie. I can’t help myself.</p>
<p>But only to clear up the difference between Pilgrims and Puritans and also to talk about Squanto.</p>
<p>God I love me some Squanto. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>Most of the English men and women who settled in New England were uber-Protestant Puritans</p>
<p>who believed the Protestant Church of England was still too Catholic-y</p>
<p>with its kneeling and incense and extravagantly-hatted archbishops.</p>
<p>The particular Puritans who, by the way did not call themselves that – other people did,</p>
<p>who settled in new England were called Congregationalists</p>
<p>because they thought congregations should determine leadership and worship structures, not bishops.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims were even more extreme.</p>
<p>They wanted to separate more or less completely from the Church of England.</p>
<p>So first they fled to the Netherlands, but the Dutch were apparently too corrupt for them,</p>
<p>so they rounded up investors and financed a new colony in 1620.</p>
<p>They were supposed to land in Virginia, but in what perhaps should have been taken as an omen,</p>
<p>they were blown wildly off course and ended up in what’s now Massachusetts, founding a colony called Plymouth.</p>
<p>While still on board their ship the Mayflower,</p>
<p>41 of the 150 or so colonists wrote and signed an agreement called the Mayflower Compact,</p>
<p>in which they all bound themselves to follow “just and equal laws” that their chosen representatives would write-up.</p>
<p>Since this was the first written framework for government in the US, it’s kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>But anyway, the Pilgrims had the excellent fortune of landing in Massachusetts with 6 weeks before winter,</p>
<p>and they had the good sense not to bring very much food with them or any farm animals.</p>
<p>Half of them died before winter was out.</p>
<p>The only reason they didn’t all die was that local Indians led by Squanto gave them food and saved them.</p>
<p>A year later, grateful that they had survived mainly due to the help of an alliance with the local chief Massasoit,</p>
<p>and because the Indians had taught them how to plant corn and where to catch fish,</p>
<p>the Pilgrims held a big feast: the first Thanksgiving. Thanks Thought Bubble!</p>
<p>And by the way, that feast was on the fourth Thursday in November,</p>
<p>not mid-October as is celebrated in some of these green areas we call Not America.</p>
<p>Anyway Squanto was a pretty amazing character and not only because he helped save the Pilgrims.</p>
<p>He found that almost all of his tribe, the Patuxet had been wiped out by disease</p>
<p>and eventually settled with the Pilgrims on the site of his former village and then died…</p>
<p>of disease because it is always ruining everything.</p>
<p>So the Pilgrims struggled on until 1691</p>
<p>when their colony was subsumed by the larger and much more successful Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Bay colony was chartered in 1629 by London merchants who,</p>
<p>like the founders of the Virginia Company, hoped to make money.</p>
<p>But unlike Virginia, the board of directors relocated from England to America,</p>
<p>which meant that in Massachusetts they had a greater degree of autonomy and self-government than they did in Virginia.</p>
<p>Social unity was also much more important in Massachusetts than it was in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Puritans’ religious mission meant that the common good was, at least at first,</p>
<p>put above the needs or the rights of the individual.</p>
<p>Those different ideas in the North and South about the role of government would continue…until now.</p>
<p>Oh God. It’s time for the mystery document?</p>
<p>The rules are simple. I read the mystery document which I have not seen before.</p>
<p>If I get it right, then I do not get shocked with the shock pen, and if I get it wrong I do.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>“We must be knit together in this work as one man, we must entertain each other in brotherly affection,</p>
<p>we must be willing to abridge ourselves of our superfluities (su-per-fluities? I don’t know),</p>
<p>for the supply of others necessities,</p>
<p>we must uphold a familiar commerce together in all meekness, gentleness, patience and liberality,</p>
<p>…for we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us;</p>
<p>so that if we shall deal falsely with our god in this work we have undertaken</p>
<p>and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us,</p>
<p>we shall be made a story and a byword through the world.”</p>
<p>Alright, first thing I noticed: the author of this document is a terrible speller</p>
<p>or possibly wrote this before English was standardized.</p>
<p>Also, a pretty religious individual.</p>
<p>And the community in question seems to embrace something near socialism:</p>
<p>abridging the superfluous for others’ necessities.</p>
<p>Also it says that the community should be like a city upon a hill, like a model for everybody.</p>
<p>And because of that metaphor, I know exactly where it comes from:</p>
<p>the sermon “A Model of Christian Charity” by John Winthrop.</p>
<p>Yes! Yes! No punishment!</p>
<p>This is one of the most important sermons in American history.</p>
<p>It shows us just how religious the Puritans were,</p>
<p>but it also shows us that their religious mission wasn’t really one of individualism but of collective effort.</p>
<p>In other words, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.</p>
<p>But this city on a hill metaphor is the basis for one kind of American exceptionalism:</p>
<p>the idea that we are so special and so godly that we will be a model to other nations,</p>
<p>at least as long, according to Winthrop, as we act together.</p>
<p>Lest you think Winthrop’s words were forgotten,</p>
<p>they did become the centerpiece of Ronald Reagan’s 1989 farewell address.</p>
<p>Okay so New England towns were governed democratically,</p>
<p>but that doesn’t mean that the Puritans were big on equality</p>
<p>or that everybody was able to participate in government because no.</p>
<p>The only people who could vote or hold office were church members,</p>
<p>and to be a full church member you had to be a “visible saint”,</p>
<p>so really, power stayed in the hands of the church elite. The same went for equality.</p>
<p>While it was better than in the Chesapeake Colonies or England, as equality went…eh, pretty unequal.</p>
<p>As John Winthrop declared, “Some must be rich, and some poor.</p>
<p>Some high, an eminent in power, and dignity; others mean and in subjection.”</p>
<p>Or as historian Eric Foner put it</p>
<p>“Inequality was considered an expression of God’s will and while some liberties applied to all inhabitants,</p>
<p>there were separate lists of rights for freemen, women, children and servants.”</p>
<p>There was also slavery in Massachusetts. The first slaves were recorded in the colony in 1640.</p>
<p>However, Puritans really did foster equality in one sense.</p>
<p>They wanted everyone to be able to read the Bible.</p>
<p>In fact, parents could be punished by the town councils for not properly instructing</p>
<p>their children in making them literate.</p>
<p>But when Roger Williams called for citizens to be able to practice any religion they chose,</p>
<p>he was banished from the colonies.</p>
<p>So was Ann Hutchinson who argued the church membership should be based on inner grace</p>
<p>and not on outward manifestations like church attendance.</p>
<p>Williams went on to found Rhode Island, so that worked out fine for him,</p>
<p>but Hutchinson, who was doubly threatening to Massachusetts</p>
<p>because she was a woman preaching unorthodox ideas,</p>
<p>was too radical and was further banished to Westchester, New York where she and her family were killed by Indians.</p>
<p>Finally, somebody who doesn’t die of disease or starvation.</p>
<p>So Americans like to think of their country as being founded by pioneers of religious freedom</p>
<p>who were seeking liberty from the oppressive English.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen that’s only partly true.</p>
<p>For one thing, Puritan ideas of equality and representation weren’t particularly equitable or representational.</p>
<p>In truth, America was also founded by indigenous people and by Spanish settlers,</p>
<p>and the earliest English colonies weren’t about religion; they were about money.</p>
<p>We’ll see this tension between American mythology and American history again next week and also every week.</p>

<h1 id="10"><a href="#10" class="headerlink" title="10"></a>10</h1><p>Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course US History, and today we’re going to discuss Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>We’re going to learn about how America became a thriving nation of small, independent farmers,</p>
<p>eschewing manufacturing and world trade,</p>
<p>and becoming the richest and most powerful nation in the world in the 19th century, all thanks to the vision of Thomas Jefferson,</p>
<p>the greatest and most intellectually consistent Founding Father, who founded the University of Virginia and grew 20 varieties of peas at Monticello.</p>
<p>Me From the Past, get to your desk!</p>
<p>In a stunning turn of events, Me From the Past is an idiot and Jefferson is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>[Theme Music]</p>
<p>So in 1800, Thomas Jefferson, pictured here – this is the third time that we’ve featured Thomas Jefferson on the chalkboard, so we had to go a little Warhol on it.</p>
<p>Right, so, Jefferson, the Republican, ran against John Adams, the Federalist.</p>
<p>1800 was the first election where both parties ran candidates and actually campaigned.</p>
<p>And, surprisingly, the Federalist’s elitist strategy of “vote for Adams because he’s better than you” did not work.</p>
<p>Now, both parties realize that it was important to coordinate their electoral strategy to make sure that the vice presidential candidate got at least one fewer electoral votes than the presidential candidate.</p>
<p>But then the Republican elector who was supposed to throw his vote away forgot to, so there ended up being a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>As per the Constitution, the election went to the House of Representatives, where it took 36 ballots and the intervention of Alexander Hamilton before Jefferson was finally named president.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Burr and Hamilton really disliked each other, and not in like, the passive-aggressive way that politicians dislike each other these days,</p>
<p>but in the four-years-later-they-would-have-a-duel-and-Burr-killed-Hamilton kind of way.</p>
<p>A duel which occurred, wait for it, in New Jersey.</p>
<p>But anyway, shortly after the election of 1800, the 12th Amendment was passed, making the Electoral College simpler, but not as simple as, say, you know, one person’s vote counting as one vote.</p>
<p>Anyway, complain about the Electoral College all you want, but without it, we would never have had President Rutherford B. Hayes, and just look at that beard!</p>
<p>So Jefferson became president and his election showed that Americans wanted a more democratic politics, where common people were more free to express their opinions.</p>
<p>The Federalists were never really a threat again in presidential politics.</p>
<p>And, arguably, the best thing that John Adams ever did was transfer power in an orderly and honorable way to his rival, Jefferson.</p>
<p>Jefferson’s campaign slogan was “Jefferson and Liberty,” but the liberty in question was severely limited.</p>
<p>Only a fraction of white men were allowed to vote and, of course, there was no liberty for the slaves.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of contentious debate on the subject of Jefferson and slavery, but here’s my two cents, which I should not be allowed to contribute because we should only round to the nearest nickel, which, by the way, features Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>So Thomas Jefferson was a racist and he wrote about black people’s inherent inferiority to whites and Native Americans, and the fact that he fathered children with one of his slaves doesn’t change that.</p>
<p>George Washington freed his slaves upon his death. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>They were supposed to be freed upon his wife’s death, but living in a house full of people who were waiting for you to die made Martha want to free them while she was still alive.</p>
<p>But with few exceptions, Jefferson didn’t free his slaves upon his death and throughout his life, he used the sale of slaves to finance his lavish lifestyle.</p>
<p>And this leads to two big philosophical questions when it comes to history.</p>
<p>First, if Jefferson clearly did not think that black people were the intellectual or moral equals of whites and was perfectly comfortable keeping them in bondage,</p>
<p>then what does the most important phrase of the Declaration of Independence actually mean?</p>
<p>And the second question is even broader:</p>
<p>Does it matter if a person of tremendous historical importance had terrible aspects to their character?</p>
<p>Does being a bad person diminish your accomplishments?</p>
<p>I don’t have a great answer for those questions, but I will tell you that no remembers Richard Nixon for starting the EPA.</p>
<p>But this is very important to understand: Slaves were aware of concept of liberty and they wanted it.</p>
<p>So in addition to an election, 1800 also saw one of the first large-scale slave uprisings.</p>
<p>Gabriel’s Rebellion was organized by a Richmond, Virginia blacksmith who hoped to seize the capital, kill some of its inhabitants, and hold the rest hostage until his demands for abolition were met.</p>
<p>But the plot was discovered before they could carry it out and Gabriel, along with 25 other slaves, was hanged.</p>
<p>But after the rebellion, Virginians, if they didn’t know it already, were very aware that slaves wanted and expected liberty.</p>
<p>And the response was predictable: Virginia made its laws concerning slaves much harsher.</p>
<p>It became illegal for slaves to meet in groups on Sundays unless supervised by whites, and it became much more difficult for whites to legally free their slaves.</p>
<p>Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?</p>
<p>The rules here are simple:</p>
<p>Identify the author, no shock; fail to identify the author, shock.</p>
<p>“The love of freedom, sir, is an inborn sentiment, which the god of nature has planted deep in the heart:</p>
<p>long may it be kept under by the arbitrary institutions of society;</p>
<p>but, at the first favorable moment, it springs forth, and flourishes with a vigour that defies all check.</p>
<p>This celestial spark, which fires the breast of the savage, which glows in that of the philosopher, is not extinguished in the bosom of the slave.</p>
<p>It may be buried in the embers; but it still lives; and the breath of knowledge kindles it to flame.</p>
<p>Thus we find, sir, there have never been slaves in any country who have not seized the first favorable opportunity to revolt.”</p>
<p>I mean, from the bit at the beginning about the love of freedom, it seems like it could be Jefferson, but the rest does not seem like Jefferson.</p>
<p>Probably wasn’t a slave, since they were denied access to education precisely because the “breath of knowledge” is so dangerous to the institution of slavery.</p>
<p>Oh, this is looking pretty bleak for me, Stan. Mmmmmm. John Jay?</p>
<p>[buzzing noise] Dang it!</p>
<p>Who was it? George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Who the John C. Calhoun is George Tucker?!</p>
<p>Is there a person watching this who knew that it was George Tucker?</p>
<p>Fine! [electricity noise] Gah!</p>
<p>Apparently George Tucker was a member of the General Assembly of Virginia and the Mystery Document was a description of Gabriel’s Rebellion that suggested a solution to the inherent problem of rebellious slaves.</p>
<p>He argued that we should set up a colony for them in Indian territory in Georgia, which, of course, also wouldn’t have worked because we were soon to steal that territory.</p>
<p>But back to Jefferson.</p>
<p>His idea was to make the government smaller, lower taxes, shrink the military, and make it possible for America to become a bucolic, agrarian, empire of liberty,</p>
<p>rather than an English-style, industrial, mercantile, nightmare landscape.</p>
<p>So how did he do? Well, really well at first.</p>
<p>Jefferson got rid of all the taxes, except for the tariff, especially the Whiskey Tax.</p>
<p>And then, when he woke up with a terrible, cheap whiskey-induced hangover, he paid off part of the national debt.</p>
<p>He shrunk the army and the navy, and basically made sure that America wouldn’t become a centralized, English-style state for at least the next 60 years.</p>
<p>Low taxes and small government sounds great, but no navy?</p>
<p>That would be tough, especially when we needed ships and marines to fight the Barbary pirates “on the shores of Tripoli,” who kept capturing our ships in the Mediterranean and enslaving their crews.</p>
<p>This is yet another example of how foreign affairs keeps getting in the way of domestic priorities;</p>
<p>in this case, the domestic priority of not wanting to spend money on a navy.</p>
<p>Also, vitally, Jefferson’s presidency really marks the last time in history when a Republican president didn’t want to spend money on the military.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: Democrats can do it too. I’m looking at you, LBJ.</p>
<p>As much as he wanted to get rid of any trace of the Federalists, Jefferson found himself thwarted by that imminently conservative and undemocratic institution: the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Jefferson appointed Republicans to most government positions, but he couldn’t do anything about the Supreme Court because they serve for life.</p>
<p>And since the country was only like, 12 years old, they were all still pretty fresh.</p>
<p>Most important among them was Chief Justice John Marshall, who happened to be a Federalist.</p>
<p>Marshall was Chief Justice basically forever and is, without question, the most important figure in the history of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He wrote a number of key opinions, but none was more important than the 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison is so important because in that decision, the Supreme Court gave itself the power of judicial review, which allows it to uphold or invalidate federal laws.</p>
<p>The Court then extended this power to state laws in Fletcher v. Peck and eventually even to executive actions.</p>
<p>Like, we think of the main job of the Supreme Court being to declare laws unconstitutional, but that power isn’t anywhere in the Constitution itself.</p>
<p>Marbury v. Madison gave the Court that power and without it, the Supreme Court would probably be a footnote in American history.</p>
<p>So unlike Marshall, Jefferson and the Republicans were big proponents of strict construction:</p>
<p>the idea that the Constitution should be read as literally as possible as way of limiting the power of the federal government.</p>
<p>The problem is, there might be things the government wants to do that the Constitution didn’t account for, like, for instance, buying a large tract of land from Napoleon, who, as we remember from Crash Course World History, complicates everything.</p>
<p>Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>So yeah, Jefferson basically doubled the size of the US in what came to be known as the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
<p>Napoleon was eager to sell it, because the rebellion in Haiti had soured him on the whole idea of colonies, and also because he needed money.</p>
<p>Jefferson wanted to purchase New Orleans because western farmers were shipping their products through the city and when he approached France about this, Napoleon was like,</p>
<p>“Hey! How bout I sell you, this!”</p>
<p>Jefferson couldn’t turn down that deal, so he bought the whole kit and caboodle for $15 million, which is worth about $250 million today.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, a new aircraft carrier costs about $4.5 billion, so he got a good deal.</p>
<p>What’s the problem with this?</p>
<p>Well, nothing if you believe in a powerful government that can do stuff that’s not in the Constitution.</p>
<p>But if you’re a strict Constructionist like Jefferson, you have to reconcile this obviously beneficial act with there being no mention in the Constitution of the president being able to purchase land in order to expand the size of the US.</p>
<p>So laying scruple aside, Jefferson bought Louisiana and then sent Lewis and Clark to explore it, which they did, even going beyond the boundaries of the Purchase all the way to the Pacific.</p>
<p>And this was so cool that it almost makes us forget that it was kind of unconstitutional and a huge power grab for the president.</p>
<p>So the question is: why did he do it?</p>
<p>Jefferson’s desire to increase the size of the country prompted Federalists to complain that,</p>
<p>“We are to give money, of which we have too little, for land, of which we already have too much.”</p>
<p>By doubling the size of the country, Jefferson could ensure that there would be enough land for every white man to have his own small farm.</p>
<p>And this, in turn, would ensure that Americans would remain independent and virtuous.</p>
<p>Because only a small farmer who doesn’t have to depend on the market for food or shelter or anything really (well, except slaves), can be truly independent, and thus capable of participating in a nation of free men.</p>
<p>Thanks, Thought Bubble.</p>
<p>And this desire to create a nation of independent farmers producing only primary products helps explains Jefferson’s other incredibly controversial policy: the embargo.</p>
<p>Jefferson imposed the embargo in order to punish Britain for its practice of impressing American sailors, as well as its blockade of France, with whom Britain was once again, or possibly just still, at war.</p>
<p>So basically, Jefferson wanted free trade among nations and his solution was to get Congress to forbid all American ships from sailing to foreign ports.</p>
<p>The theory was that the British were so dependent on American primary products, like wood and cotton, that if we cut off trade with them, the British would stop impressing American sailors and end their blockade.</p>
<p>What’s the connection between free trade and Jefferson’s agrarian ideal?</p>
<p>Well, the idea was that America would trade its primary products for Europe’s manufactured goods, so that the US wouldn’t have to develop any manufacturing capacity of its own.</p>
<p>Alas, or perhaps fortunately, this did not work.</p>
<p>For one thing, Britain and France were too busy fighting each other even to notice America’s embargo.</p>
<p>So they just continued blockading and impressing.</p>
<p>Also, the embargo devastated the American economy.</p>
<p>I mean, exports dropped by 80%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not being able to import European manufactured goods only served to spur American manufacturing.</p>
<p>I mean, Jefferson might have wanted Americans to be a bunch of self-sufficient farmers, but Americans wanted European manufactured stuff, like teapots and clocks and microwaves.</p>
<p>Well, then how did they cook stuff, Stan?</p>
<p>And if they couldn’t get that stuff from Britain, they would just make it themselves.</p>
<p>So in terms of Jefferson’s agrarian ideal, the embargo was a massive failure.</p>
<p>And lastly, the embargo limited the power of the federal government about as much as crystal meth limits cavities.</p>
<p>I mean, imposing the embargo was a colossal use of federal power and it was also an imposition on people’s liberties.</p>
<p>The problem the embargo was supposed to solve didn’t go away and, as we’ll discuss next week, it eventually led to the US’s first declared war.</p>
<p>For now, I want to leave you with this: Thomas Jefferson is revered and reviled in almost equal measure in American history.</p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence, which he mainly drafted, is a signal achievement delineating some heroic ideas for the founding of the United States, but also embedding some of its crucial shortcomings.</p>
<p>And Jefferson’s presidency is like that too.</p>
<p>He claimed to champion small government, but he enlarged federal power more than Washington or Adams ever did.</p>
<p>He imagined an agrarian republic, but his policies led to increased manufacturing.</p>
<p>He wanted to foster freedom, but he owned slaves and took land from the Indians.</p>

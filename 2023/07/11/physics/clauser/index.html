        <p> so our next speaker is  John klauser he was born in Pasadena  California Us in 1942. he studied  undergraduate physics at Caltech and  Colombia University New York  and received a PhD in physics from  Columbia University in 1969  from 1969 to  1997 he worked at University of  California Berkeley  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  and Lawrence leave them all National  Laboratory he’s pressed presently  research physicist at his own private  lab in Walnut Creek California  so please join me in welcoming John  closer to the stage to tell us about the  development that led to this year’s  price  oops no  wait a minute  poof  I’m not  I’m not connected no  that’s we’re not  something is not right uh let me start  over again then here  okay  okay uh  what I did in all of this  was  the first experiments to actually uh  test what uh John Bell had shown us was  probably one of the most important uh  discoveries I I would think of uh the  recent decade or the recent Century if  in fact  the  so these are so I will discuss the  experiments  and then  a in order to  understand the experiments  Mike horn and I developed what’s now  called the theory of local realism  which is in essence  Einstein’s whole program for uh doing  physics  and unfortunately it’s wrong  which is what the experiments show  and finally I will end with the  uh  does this work yeah  uh  discussion of why I still am totally  confused about what’s going on with  quantum mechanics  okay let me start with question is what  is quantum mechanic what is quantum  entanglement  okay uh  quantum entanglement  uh started out with Schrodinger  Schrodinger produced not one but two  important equations  you started out with the first uh  equation  which was for single particles  the  particular hydrogen which has a single  electron  and he miraculously it described the  structure the structure and the energy  levels of hydrogen  but more complicated was helium which  had two electrons so he produces a a a  second uh  equation  which now involves  two electrons the two are very different  equations  the second one allows quantum  entanglement  which is a  new equate uh Solutions  emerged from from the second equation  and the  peculiarity is that the two electrons  are now intimately uh correlated  at the time nobody suggested doing any  experiments to test this rather bizarre  prediction however both Einstein and  Schrodinger were very disturbed by this  phenomenon  and in fact uh Einstein badalski Rosen  in 35  proposed the addition of additional  variables through quantum mechanics to  in order to explain what’s going on  Niels Bohr on the other hand said no  they’re not needed  and and I discussed all of this very  nicely  so one of the question first questions I  was asked when I was talking about this  in the uh Swedish Embassy uh a couple of  weeks ago  was  what is a bell inequality this is what  we in fact uh tested there’s not one but  there’s actually three important bill  inequalities that I want to talk about  the first of course was John Bell’s 1964  inequality  but uh uh and I’ll described very nicely  there’s one problem with  being of the theory  in order to be useful a theory must make  an experimental prediction and  unfortunately uh John Bell’s uh  uh paper made no experimental  predictions because it made demanded  a perfect experiment and uh which which  had certain uh certainty in the outcomes  and as  uh Ben Franklin pointed about the only  thing certain in life are or in nature  are death and taxes  unfortunately this is not Texas so the  uh  uh  with uh help from uh my associates uh  Mike Horn uh admir shimone and Dick Holt  who is here in the in the audience  uh  uh We’ve uh produced the uh closer horns  for money Holt now commonly referred to  as chsh inequality which was made the uh  first real testable experimental  prediction  so and we proposed a detailed experiment  to do that  and we noticed various important  loopholes uh one of which of course was  mentioned that he tested but a very  important loophole was that the data  really couldn’t violate the inequality  on their own so we had to add some  additional assumptions  so  the third inequality is now uh the was  uh produced by Mike horn and I uh in  1974 and it is the first loophole free  experimentally testable uh  uh inequality  okay let’s start with the first one uh  Atlanta’s already noticed this  I signed panelski Rosen had always and  and others had always assumed that that  quantum mechanics always made uh correct  predictions  the grand irony of this Bell’s paper  is that he showed  that Einstein’s original  intent of that paper was exactly the  opposite of what was true  that the if they wanted to show that  that the correct predictions led to  uh the need for hidden variables and  what bell showed was that if you put it  hidden variables in then you can’t get  the uh predictions of quantum mechanics  so again I said it was not really  testable  so uh  chsh in 1969  we were inspired by this work and said  wondered well this can we really relieve  the  get rid of Einstein’s requirement for a  perfect experiment and indeed we found  yes we could  and so we designed an experiment  uh to actually test it we worked out all  the details of what you uh you needed to  do in order to test it  uh and that was the first actual hard  experimental prediction  uh and it doesn’t you require uh bills  uh impossible to achieve its conditions  so uh we now have two theories two  different sets of predictions quantum  mechanics and bills uh the CH  inequalities prediction  so being an experimentalist let’s  actually do an experiment and find out  which one is true  so in order to do this we had to add a  minor supplementary conditions but they  were we believe that they’re of quite  reasonable rather weak  Okay the third inequality  is the  CH or the closer horn inequality that  was developed in 1974  uh and it was to test uh what is now  called local realism  we wanted to we wondered when we were  doing  the experiments  we wondered  what is really being tested here is it  just the addition of hidden variables or  is it something more profound than that  and we found that indeed it is far more  profound it was a test of Einstein’s  whole platform for doing physics  that we effectively were putting him out  of business  and so when we and in fact  the theory when we develop it was  effectively Dead on Arrival it was  already refuted  but nonetheless we tried to put it in as  clear as possible set of terms as we  could  so and in the process we formatted a new  inequality the CH inequality and it  allows loophole free tests  so uh now if with some even milder  additional assumptions then the first  experiments that uh that I had done uh  72 and 76 uh actually knocked it out so  that it was already dead  more recently and it’s taken a long time  because the technology did not exist at  all to in order to test it in 1974.  uh it has now been tested conclusively  with so now without any loopholes at all  one can say uh and I agree with the last  early uh conclusion it’s dead Jim  so  what are some of the experiments uh  there are three important ones that that  I did uh first was with Stu Friedman who  was a graduate student at UC Berkeley in  19 uh we published a results in 1972 and  this was the the first experiment to  actually test the chsh inequality  in the  in parallel with us  as Nicole I mentioned who is here was  working with Frank Pipkin at Harvard  and  they got the opposite result  oops one of us is is in trouble  so they decided not to publish they were  skeptical of their results  but now I’m skeptical of my results so  uh what do I do well I just decided Well  I needed to uh repeat uh their version  of the experiment which I did in 1976.  and then there’s just along the way  one of our assumptions had uh and I was  kind of searching for loopholes  uh had required photons to act like  particles but I discovered that there  was no actual experimentals uh proof  that that particles that photons did act  like particles so I did an experiment 74  to prove that okay so here is the the  first experiment  a picture of it and that all at the uh  right in it was a very young Stu  Friedman uh in the middle is a the  atomic beam apparatus sitting there  pumping away oil leaking all over the  floor  pair of polarizers on each side which  would which would rotate  so and this one became a stu Friedman’s  PhD thesis at uh  uh Cal Berkeley  so what we did is we had a calcium  Atomic beam and we excited it with this  UV lab very weak extension we wished  we’d had lasers which didn’t exist at  the time  so uh we got 6.3 Sigma result I mean the  five Sigma uh Criterion that is now  common was invented by Louis Alvarez at  Berkeley and he he uh was a a strong  Taskmaster on any experimental results  that came out of Berkeley  so  this was the the second experiment which  I did I mentioned uh this was a repeat  of the whole uh Pipkin experiment  I use the same polarizers but I used  their uh uh Source uh of mercury uh  foreign  the two photons  and Dick Hort uh hold uh very generously  taught me how to do it uh could not uh  there’s a it’s not an easy and that is  my Nobel artifact that I have donated is  one of the the sources  so it used Mercury uh with an electron  beam exciting yeah the atoms  and I got at least a four Sigma  result there  and we use this the same protocol in  order to uh introduce the the  assumptions  so the  other experiment that I mentioned  had to deal with it did particles was  there a real way  experimentally demonstrated wave  particle duality for photons  photons started in 1917  when Einstein was trying to explain  how do does a gas  and  a thermal uh applied spectrum of Life  come to equilibrium thermal equilibrium  with each other  and he noticed that  photons had to be behave by what he  called directional energy bundles  uh we now call them photons  then Schrodinger  noticed  that  what’s the difference between asking the  question well what’s the difference  between a particle and a wave  well a a wave could be just as a  classical pulse of light  and that is commonly referred to as the  old Schrodinger uh interpretation so how  does one tell tell them apart  suppose you have a source and you send  light through a half silver mirror  if it’s a wave  the wave will go both ways  reduced intensity  if it’s a particle  the particle will go  one way  or the other  now if I have two detectors  behind the uh  the half silvered mirror  if it’s a wave  they will both see this pulse and there  will be finite a probability that both  will register simultaneously  if it’s a particle only one of them  so how does one uh do that uh so  actually Schrodinger suggested this and  yannisi and uh Budapest actually tried  it but unfortunately they put in did an  inconclusive experiment so I went back  and started figured out how did one do  it totally conclusively and uh  so I did it actually where you’re using  the the same source that are used for  the uh producing  the for the Mercury uh bellotherm  experiment uh who had  photons going in both ways and two half  silver mirrors and using some a work  front by uh Glover’s formulation what  could show  that’s the The Coincidence rate between  here and here  there should be none of course if if  it’s a particle but but there should be  an anomalous if it’s a wave  uh a coincidence rate the product of  these two coincidence rates here and  here uh must be greater than  the the uh  Pro uh  the product of these coincidence rates  and so here’s the data and it’s quite  the opposite by about uh 20 Sigma  so indeed particles  to do act uh photons do act like  particles  so  as I mentioned before  Mike horn and I were trying to  understand what it is that  Bell’s theorem experiments actually say  so we developed What’s called the theory  of local realism  originally we called it objective local  theories uh in our first paper on it and  it’s an extremely general theory that  takes it to account all of the basic uh  elements of Einstein’s platform  and  uh  in along the way we produced the CH  inequality which is actually a hard  experimental prediction with no  loopholes we did not have any Assumption  of causality which we had earlier in  there was no Behavior requirement for a  particle like Behavior  uh and then there was some discussion  among various other workers John Bell  and admir shimoni added additional  components so presumably  uh it is better called Bill clauser Horn  shimoni local realism  it’s very short-lived as I mentioned it  was already Dead on Arrival  but that wasn’t good enough it had to  really be shown to be dead with no  loopholes  to it by testing  okay what does it assume  localism is extremely Simple Theory  Anton zeilinger and please quote me uh  tell me if if I am misquoting you at one  point he had a conference he said  if  Belle’s inequality  and local over realism had been  discovered  before quantum mechanics  it is so reasonable it would have been  taken as a law of nature or adapted as a  law of nature uh  unfortunately it’s wrong  so what does local realism assume  it assumes  that nature is made out of stuff  um well what is stuff well we we may not  even know what it is it is uh  it is what  I signed Podolski Rosen referred to as  elements of reality it’s what we call  matter or  uh uh What uh closer horn called objects  John Bell referred to it as beebles it’s  there it’s distributed throughout space  now actually Einstein’s whole program in  general as if any in particular goes a  lot further  and he said they said says that well it  has a finite mass energy density and it  it is that density that determines the  whole geometry of the universe  we don’t need that for local realism all  we need is that it’s there  so it could it could evolve  stochastically or it could evolve  uh deterministically we don’t care  it’s stuff  is stuff you can put in a box  you could uh throughout it and it’s the  stuff that’s in the Box  if you’re doing an experiment  the stuff determines the probabilities  of the experiment that you actually do  there  we assume that there are Real Results  the that happen when you do an  experiment  that is  uh  unlike uh Schrodinger actually he he  thought the whole idea of the The Cat In  The Box experiment was a total of  absurdity  we assume that the cat is either alive  or dead and we just don’t know which  that a real result always occurs  presumed that the properties of the  stuff  determine the results of an experiment  you do  the  if you have a parameter setting on your  apparatus  and then you change the parameter  setting presumably you will get a  different result  so what does it predict  well suppose you have two very widely  separated boxes each has stuff in it and  you’re doing experiments in these two uh  wide separated boxes  so you’ve hurt the Assumption the  following Einstein’s uh  requirement for locality is that stuff  in one box  and the out of the  parameter settings  uh the result of the experiment in one  box measuring that stuff cannot be  influenced by the parameter setting  Choice made in the distant box  that’s all you need to produce  uh  uh the uh  the closer horn inequality  okay so here’s what are boxes well  they’re just closed surfaces they  separate each closed surface separates  has a  an inside and an outside  so here we have a pair of boxes  okay these characters are uh well I made  that drawing in  1976 uh before the characters had been  named uh Alice and Bob well okay so this  but she but she perhaps trans I don’t  know  so what uh  here we have  Alice and Bob making measurements  and they get a result yes no on each  side  so we have our boxes here are now  shrinking at the speed of light  and so there’s drawn so that we’re doing  the experiments when there’s space like  separated  so if I plotted versus X and time  uh here are the boxes  shrinking  uh simultaneously and doing experiments  so the assumption is that stuff back  here in the common overlap region is  what is the result of of the extremist  if you read some of John Bell’s stuff  you have to be careful for some reason  he had these reverse he had the arrow of  time going to the left uh I’m sure he  had a reason for it but I don’t know  what it was  okay  it’s dead Jim  I apologize to Star Trek  who was for a long time it was very  difficult to do this the technology just  simply did not exist back in 74.  but it has improved  so  it became very important to eliminate  the loopholes in the earlier CH tests of  the chsh inequality and uh  to really do a loophole free experiment  and finally most recently at a labs in  Vienna  and in Champaign Urbana uh Illinois  uh  it has been totally killed dead  okay  now I will use what my time remaining  to make a  a value statement if you will about why  I have the fattest idea what’s going on  and I argue that in fact there’s been an  elephant in the room pardon the metaphor  that has been hanging around ever since  uh Schrodinger and epr  remember the trottinger produced two  very different equations  he had one for hydrogen with only a  single particle  and he had another one for helium which  had two particles  nobody seemed concerned at the time  about the fact that these two equations  were formulated in very different spaces  and they I are what I believe is  improperly linked and I’ll go on to that  in a minute by what I call borns  ambiguity born was the one who who said  that they are equivalent  and this this has been the elephant’s  been hiding in plain sight  and I noticed that in fact the Einstein  podolsky Rosen art debate a bore debate  was never really settled  various textbook authors  believed one or the other of the authors  and they’re developed in the literature  in the textbook industry two very  different schools of thought and  most people never seem to notice this  but  with the Advent of local realism and  quantum entanglement  then it became clear that one could  actually contrast and identify these two  schools of thought  okay School number one either is  essentially a form of local realism  so one of the textbooks that promote uh  uh uh the  School number one  it is what I call the laboratory space  formulation of quantum mechanics  okay it was taught you’re all I kind of  cut off the uh the list at about 1980  begin at first was born born’s textbook  two very important uh textbooks uh  familiar Dickie and whitkey and  mersbacher were very popular  uh all follow this uh  like for example inborn case  the waves are propagating in the lab and  he shows pictures of waves moving around  all of these books show waves in the it  was propagating through a two-slit  experiment in lab space  Feynman uh this is his review article  1948 even puts it into the title this is  a space-time uh operation French French  and Taylor uh using MIT and of course  the Original Classic shift  okay what is School number one  Quantum Mechanics for single particle  systems is formulated in lab space or  real space the XYZ of this room  and Heather is a point every point in  this lab space has a vector to it  and Schrodinger’s wave function is a  function of its position uh in the room  or in the lab  and more importantly  the probability density PSI star PSI  is a function of his position in the  room  it is  the evolution of  of these waves is governed by  Schrodinger’s equation in lab space  and it depicts waves of probability  you’ve probably heard any number of  people describe quantum mechanics says  waves the probability moreover there’s  also it’s defined by born a conserved uh  probability current which flows like a  fluid through through the lab  and he famously used that uh of current  to describe flux conservation  frieden Rutherford scattering  unfortunately  it only works the slab school of thought  number one only works for single  particle  systems it cannot describe  two particle systems or and it cannot  describe entanglement  so what’s goal number two  also had a large group of textbooks  which very specifically said we are in  configuration space  okay probably one of the most important  ones but beta and saw Peter with the  authoritative work on hydrogen and  helium Jordan and Drell relative is a  quantum mechanics caught in and shortly  uh  calculate Spectra of atoms  land down on lift shits great quantum  mechanics to expect it was translated by  John Bell actually and messiah’s famous  book  uh  except he he claims he’s in in  configuration space but actually he  cheats a bit  and probably most importantly fall was  Von Neumann’s textbook  okay what is  the configuration space  School  of quantum mechanics  it is a very very different from what I  just described  the wave function  depends on A System’s degrees of freedom  this Kim’s there could be many of them  uh there could be k degrees of some  large number k  and  so we have a wave function and these are  all this is straight out of Von  Neumann’s uh both  so if you have say two particles in  helium then  now the argument space of the wave  function is very different it has an x y  z of particle one XYZ of particle two  wait  our lab does not have six dimensions  something has dramatically changed  importantly  the  position in the lab  is not one of the arguments that means  that its value is the same everywhere is  base unlike the lab space formulation  that there were it’s different every  point in space  so Schrodinger’s equation now is very  different it’s divided describing the  evolution of particles in this  configuration space  it’s an abstract mathematical space  it is not at all this the space uh that  Star Trek was exploring  the a few important and it’s absolutely  required if you want to discuss more  than one particle systems  borns conserved currents  cannot be drawn in  a configuration space  Green’s theorem does not apply more  importantly  the there is no prohibition  for propagation of signals faster than  life in configuration space it’s a  purely  arbitrary space  totally as fact it’s what the  imaginations call a vector space not at  all  so  it was been asserted  and I as far as I could trace back this  was originally to to Bourne’s uh  dog that uh  these two cases are are the same  they are not  clearly the two uh wave functions are  very different they are not equivalent  one depends on the position of space one  does not there are no Associated  probability waves  for configuration space  so for my last slide I will describe why  I find this all totally confusing  you gotta have configuration space  in order to  describe more than one particle systems  but there’s no reason  uh that the special case of signal  particle systems should be any different  so you need a  so  and we notice really that the  lab space formulation is  uh  really a form of local realism  it’s dead Jim  so  now all of these great models  conceptual models of probability waves  propagating in space are also dead  the flow of currents probability  currents are dead  I don’t know how to visualize  propagation in configuration space  there are a lot of people here who know  a lot more quantum mechanics than I do  and maybe one of them will help me  understand  what does it mean to have a way of  propagating and configuration space I  don’t know uh thinking Wiki and Bruce  bucker were on my side they both said  gave up and said oh gee this is all our  our great models i.ei earlier uh  sections of the book we really should  throw throw away  so I have one final challenge  to my theorist friends if I still have  any  remember we said that that  general relativity  uh is a form of local realism  so and it is a general relativity that  for example gives us black holes  so  but that’s all formulated in  under a local realism Theory so my  challenge is to the theorists is it  possible to have two entangled black  hole spins  thank you </p>

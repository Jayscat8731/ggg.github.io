        <p>在此记录学习乐理的日常</p>
<p>2023.7.22.</p>
<p>昨天学了音程，小二度，大二度，小三度，大三度，纯四&#x2F;五度，增四&#x2F;五度，小六度，大六度，小七度，大七度，和一度(同音)，八度，现在可以简单区分音程关系，但是不够快速现在我在看到一个新的乐谱的时候，会先看这个乐谱的调号，我会通过看谱头有几个升记号或者降记号，通过升fa do so re la mi si和降si mi la re so do fa来判断调号，然后看哪个&#x2F;些音要升或者降，然后我会在我的琴上面把这些音找出来，但是比较慢，这个过程要大概两三分钟。现在我可以用我的小号吹出一个完整的音阶，我大概还需要一些时间，不过我想不会太久。琴行的乐理老师似乎有些好奇我为什么要来学这些东西，然后他起初的态度很不好，他似乎感觉我是一个自以为很懂的学生，其实我们只是稍微缺少一些沟通，所以我克制的很好，慢慢让他变得冷静和友好了一些，然后进行高效的学习，在本土这里我确实更为放松和适应一些，老师有那么一点诧异，他这一课塞的量非常的大(可能他就是想恶心我一下)，但是我还算顺利的弄明白了，不过归根结底我只是在功利的和他购买我想要的东西，不想浪费其他无用的精力，比如争辩什么的。所以我没有问太多不相干的问题（在此插入，我测试他的音准，挑了标准音A来测，他说是E，竟然偏了五个全音），主要专注在我的学习情况&#x2F;目的和应该按照什么顺序学习。</p>
<p>2023.7.25.</p>
<p>我现在练音准几乎是靠肌肉记忆，我每天没事干就把A听一下，然后哼一下，我现在几乎可以肌肉记忆到发出A这个音的时候喉咙的感觉，所以我先用嗓子发出这个音，然后我知道这个大概是A3。声带比较准确地记住了那个感觉，或者紧张的力度。</p>
<p>2023.8.2.</p>
<p>我此前一直在思考我学习音乐最主要的问题，以及一些没有我这样喜（热）爱音乐的人是如何将演奏学习到比我好非常非常多，或者完全碾压我（因为我直到现在的演奏都几乎没有任何能弹出来的）。</p>
<p>首先从碾压我，但是并不如我这样喜爱音乐的那些人的角度出发，对于这些人而言，他们早期的音乐学习存在一个苦练功夫的过程，这个过程他们在不是非常快乐，甚至在一个比较痛苦的过程中练习，但是这是一个非常重要的过程，即使是痛苦的练习，或者摄入新的词汇，就像痛苦的记忆英语单词，即使他们是痛苦的，但是他们也记住了，但是我几乎完全没有这个过程，所以这是我面临的一个最首要的问题，而且我终于把它想明白了。</p>
<p>首先我愿意将钢琴的旋律比拟为一种语言的形式，那么它既然作为一种语言，一定与我们常用的语言（比如我现在正在使用的汉语以及我常常使用的英语）有非常相似的地方，在此处我要重点强调的相似是他们总的信息熵，或者是说，积累他们总的信息熵的时间，乐器与一门语言是高度相似的，尤其是钢琴这样的乐器，里面存在一些我难以描述的（暂时）抽象的大概的近似（因为我无法非常准确的量化比较他们之间信息熵的转换效率），应当并非是理论上完全无法描述，只是我目前的能力还完全不足矣，应当过几年我会有更具体的量化的描述出来。</p>
<p>我现在有一定把握给他们做更为的具体的比拟</p>
<p>首先我将英语的词汇量分为三个等级（纯粹按照我自己的标准）</p>
<p>第一级 0到10000</p>
<p>第二级 10000到20000</p>
<p>第三级 20000到30000</p>
<p>第四级30000到40000</p>
<p>再往上就不分了，因为暂时没有什么意义，并且我认为再过10年也可能暂时没有什么意义。</p>
<p>好的，现在有一个非常重要的东西，我可以量化的将这套标准粗糙的，近似地代入到钢琴中，但是钢琴中的词汇可以解释为一个和弦或者一个乐句，视它的音符数量（近似比拟为字母数量），或者种类，比如古典类乐句比拟严肃文学词汇（极其抽象），然后以下是我目前开始要练习的布局。</p>
<p>第一级 0到10000 堆积占比70%，其实对我来说这个地方还可以再细分一点</p>
<p>普通钢琴老师，我要先堆到这里</p>
<p>第二级 10000到20000 堆积20%</p>
<p>何老师大约在这个中间</p>
<p>第三级 20000到30000 堆积10%</p>
<p>国际知名钢琴家</p>
<p>第四级30000到40000 堆积0%（没什么意义）</p>
<p>王羽在这里</p>
<p>我想我目前的词汇在10以下，然后我要开始堆词了，就像我以前堆积英语词汇那样，但是这一次是堆一个全新的东西，同样也是为了给我的头脑带来一些全新的思维和逻辑方式，以及我认为用一种机械（不是死板的那个意思，十只手指敲击琴键是一种物理性质的机械行为）的方式来输出信息和情感是更为可控，稳定和多元的声音类信息输出形式，是我所比较缺少或者可以全面，全新开发的。</p>
<p>现在我要考量的是我堆积这类词汇的速度和尺度，可能会相比于我堆积语言类词汇慢一些，因为毕竟语言类词汇我堆了那么多年了，而我在最开始堆语言类词汇的速率的确也非常慢。</p>
<p>我要先用两年堆到10000个，也就是普通钢琴老师的量，但是第三年我有可能可以有一个快速的上升，有可能在第三年一年我就可以堆满前两年总的量，第四年可以堆第三年的1.5倍，也就是在第四年年末堆到35000（比较难，可能性非常的低，除非我真的有巨大的passion并且给它最大量的时间，这个几乎是不可能的，因为我还需要学习很多其他的东西）</p>
<p>如果用两年堆到一万个（我还要分词汇类型，单手词，双手词，短句，中句，长句等等），也就是10000➗730，一天大概13.6句，其实这个可能还是太多了，我感觉最开始每天能堆5句就很好了。但是重要的是发挥我堆积语言类词汇的瘾。</p>
<p>2023.8.18.</p>
<p>今天突然发现我在做一个有意思的事情，就是我在超市买东西的时候，在听超市的背景音乐的时候很自然地在脑海想象它的乐谱，可能是出门的时候刚好看了完整的对Yuja wang和teddy Abrams 所作的一个非常跟意义的现代协奏曲American project 的介绍(一个时长一个小时的视频)。也有可能是我几个月前就开始跟乐谱一起听一些协奏曲或者我很喜欢的作品，并且我也想起老师之前要求我所掌握的基本音乐乐理(节奏，音高，音程)，总之在以上所有的积累之上我在听那首曲子(旋律比较简单的流行钢琴)的时候脑子里非常自然地出现了它的乐谱，包括音符的音高和时值。<br>这是一个让我非常欣喜的事情，当你能够写出你所听到旋律的乐谱，你就可以把自己脑海里原创的旋律写下来，这也是之前非常困扰我的，原先我有一些非常本能的音乐灵感，一些旋律会出现在我的脑海，甚至做梦的时候，但是毁灭性的事情是，那个时候我学院派的技能非常弱，至少我没有办法想到一个旋律立马写下来，写成书面的形式，这样的话那个旋律就此永远消失。<br>我仍然在建立一些非常重要的基本功，对于系统的音乐技能，目前对我来说很重要的就是乐谱，识谱和写谱，我感觉我大概到达它的25%的能力。最近我的音乐学习任务是，记忆钢琴88个键在乐谱上的位置，我想这个任务还需要我两三个月，然后是在听音乐的时候逐渐自然地感受出它的时值和音高，然后尝试写一些自己脑海里的旋律，或者把现成的旋律扒出来也是一种有价值的训练，有趣的是Teddy Abrams自己写的american project 这个协奏曲他自己是弹不出来的。<br>简单描述，他和王羽佳是这样一对组合<br>王羽佳自己写不出非常精美的旋律，但她可以弹出来，因为她的作曲能力相对于演奏能力弱很多<br>而Teddy Abrams 恰恰相反，他的作曲能力比演奏能力很强，所以他作出比自己演奏能力更难的曲子，让yuja wang演奏。显然我以后更有可能成为Teddy Abrams。</p>
<p>2023.10.7.</p>
<p>我按照一个严密的，科学的，学院派的方法逐渐建立我的音乐系统能力，以关键核心基本的音乐理论为扎实的基础(音阶，音高，音程，符号，节拍，认真学习和熟练记忆所有的调式，对五线谱的不断强化地阅读能力，逐渐可以业余爱好进入到专业水准。我可能很快就逐渐掌握简单的协奏曲的编曲，当然会编得很烂，完全没有Mendelssohn 的那些更精美。在扎实地学习和实践完音乐理论之后，乐器的使用可以迅速膨胀开几十种乐器类型，管乐器组的basson(高中低), 长号，圆号，小号(各种调式降b，c调，d调的)，弦乐组这边的小提琴，中提琴，大提琴，bass，每一个都稍微研究一下发音原理和演奏方法，就可以往协奏曲里添了。然后我也可以把管乐器里面的七八个都练一练，小号，长号，长笛，短笛，单簧管，双簧管，定音鼓，这几个可以全部玩一玩，如果高兴的，运气比较好的话我可以玩十几种乐器。<br>钢琴，小号(爵士和古典都能用，古典多用于高亢起始领音)，长号(爵士乐用的很舒服，古典也可以用，中部协奏用的装饰音)，法国号(这个声音太大太低了)爵士吉他，长笛(chorale很棒，拉三的第一乐章中后的天降)短笛(在普二中第一乐章出现记得我最早学音乐的方法也很野蛮，上来就想练一个art tartum 改编的tea for two融合爵士和古典的炫技短作一大堆华彩以我当时能力碰都不能碰，于是非常挫败，现在都找很简单的曲子慢慢地练我比较想学习的乐器有小号，长号，长笛，爵士吉他，弦乐器想学的不多，可能可以学中提琴或者大提琴拉低音声部的协奏，或者小，中提琴去拉中高音部位的弦乐协奏，这个东西在拉三中也非常鲜明，不过提琴不是一个非常适合独奏的乐器，一群提琴组协奏起来才是弦乐器真正的灵魂前两天印制了几本钢协的书本，其中有一Mendelssohn concerto No. 1都快被我翻烂了，拿到这份乐谱，我几乎每天翻一次或者两次，今年是最高开始在书面上研究他，去年一整年我都没有碰过乐谱，而且也已经非常非常熟悉这个作品concerto 1的旋律和内容,后来感觉乐谱应当是个好思路，我得看乐谱了，于是想办法找到了总谱，印制成册，放到书包里随身携带，随时读谱，我去年一年将Mendelssohn concerto 1这个钢协完整地听了300次，所以抽象层面来说对他非常熟悉，乐谱是一个具像化的，书面化的信息表达方式，也是一种语言的阅读，建立在我原先对旋律的高度熟悉之上，我可以勉强一边跟着音乐一般跟着乐谱的进度看过去，就是听得同时同步跟进翻阅他的乐谱，然后检查感受你看到什么，没看到什么。现在在演奏的音阶在乐谱上找到他的位置，现在在演奏的华彩乐段快速地在乐谱上找到位置，最好能够精确到能精准阅读音乐进行下去时的每一个音符，每一个大大小小的信息，从最早我只知道他现在弹到这个地方，慢慢到能够确认他弹的音，要努力抓住录音的节奏，努力抓住自己读的乐谱和演奏之间要精准地同步推进，慢慢地重复这个过程，你就会逐渐能够掌握一个168页，上千个小节的乐队总谱我有一种感觉，在我所学的这些根基上，以及拉赫，prokofiev, Maurice ravel, Mendelssohn这些人提供给我的元素之上，在不远的将来我可以创作出一些非常独特的作品，正式的，大型的，类似于门一这样正统意义的古典协奏曲，而中国迄今为止，没有任何一个人有写过这种东西，他们甚至哪个人写出这种东西的零头，不过一个中国人写的协奏曲肯定是非常值得国际音乐界怀疑或者鄙夷的，对于这点我不能确定，不过也许如果他们愿意为我演奏一次之后感觉非常不错，那样是最棒的。目前世界上还在写正统协奏曲的人也屈指可数了，我能想到的只有Teddy Abrams, MTT(久石让绝对不算，篇幅太短小，完全都没有正式的协奏曲的规格，更偏向流行乐)。</p>
<p>2023.10.8.</p>
<p>在大约今年的八月份的时候我开始认真学习乐理，最近两天非常惊喜地感觉到那个时候学习的一些基础能力我都逐渐的熟练了，主要是听写(心写)节奏，和更加精确地相对音准，我到现在仍然不知道绝对音准该怎么练习，我最开始练习绝对音准的方法是长时间的听标准音A,但是听了两个星期感觉效果非常低，后来也没有耐心再听了，以后也不知道能不能练习出绝对音准，不过我不能完全确定它对我以后的学习到底后产生什么影响，到底是积极还是消极，因为如果我如果真的有的话，我担心会滥用它，这样反而是不利的，没有它让我更加主动地去努力感受。我大概用了一个半月的时间让自己可以熟练感受一些基础的节拍类型，练习方法是在任何听到音乐的时候(比如自己听，或者超市，商场的背景音乐，或者和录音熟悉乐谱的时候)，刻意地让自己感受它的节奏时值(最开始有些刻意，后来慢慢变成无意)，我现在可以比较轻松地听出一些简单的时值类型(在整体旋律不要太复杂的情况下，一般来说流行乐是可以听出来的)，比如前2后1，前1后2，前3后1，前1后3，听四三，四八(还是八四?我不确定)，四五(从五拍开始向上非常少)，6，7，9我印象里不了解有，10拍的印象里只有一个，11向上印象里没听到过。我现在可以比较轻松地扒一点简单的谱子，但是bpm尽量不能超过100，音轨尽量不要超过三个，另外我只能听出单种音色的单音，基本上没有能力准确听写出完整的和谐(可能可以写出和弦里的一个根音)，我知道有些人可以准确听出和弦，我也想，但是我现在听不出来。<br>另外，在逐渐熟练阅读五线谱和能够在心里自然地想出听到的旋律的乐谱的时候(普通商场里听到的我可以做到音高不准确但是节奏基本准确，最常见的乐曲的节奏型非常简单，从全曲一直1111头到尾的，也会有到前1后2，然后才会前2后1，有时会出现前1后3，当然，相比于与古典协奏作品这些也当然很容易听清)，对音乐也有了全新的认识，一方面是喜悦的，另一方面缺是遗憾的。喜悦的是自己逐渐也可以和”专业人士”一样透彻地明白的它，也不会因为从前的，因为不够，专业，不够了解而对那些”作曲家，歌手”产生没必要的崇敬，因为很多的作曲的确非常烂，我现在至少有自信告诉自己哪些很烂，哪些不烂。遗憾的感受是，五线谱给我一种把音乐赤裸裸脱光在我面前的感受，高度专业化和精湛成熟的符号方法把一切都精确地展示在你面前，哪怕你听不清楚也可以轻松地用眼睛一眼看见，所以，虽然我看清了一切，但是好奇心满足之后，由原来的神秘感所带给我的憧憬便荡然无存了，这让我感到有些难过，你往往更难被一个你非常了解的东西所深刻吸引，而很多从前我非常喜爱的旋律，我现在几乎可以轻松地在听到它们的瞬间就在脑海中比较轻松地谱写出乐谱，这会让我在一定程度上对它们失去兴趣。</p>

        <p> so our next speaker is  John klauser he was born in Pasadena  California Us in 1942. he studied  undergraduate physics at Caltech and  Colombia University New York  and received a PhD in physics from  Columbia University in 1969  from 1969 to  1997 he worked at University of  California Berkeley  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  and Lawrence leave them all National  Laboratory he’s pressed presently  research physicist at his own private  lab in Walnut Creek California  so please join me in welcoming John  closer to the stage to tell us about the  development that led to this year’s  price  oops no  wait a minute  poof  I’m not  I’m not connected no  that’s we’re not  something is not right uh let me start  over again then here  okay  okay uh  what I did in all of this  was  the first experiments to actually uh  test what uh John Bell had shown us was  probably one of the most important uh  discoveries I I would think of uh the  recent decade or the recent Century if  in fact  the  so these are so I will discuss the  experiments  and then  a in order to  understand the experiments  Mike horn and I developed what’s now  called the theory of local realism  which is in essence  Einstein’s whole program for uh doing  physics  and unfortunately it’s wrong  which is what the experiments show  and finally I will end with the  uh  does this work yeah  uh  discussion of why I still am totally  confused about what’s going on with  quantum mechanics  okay let me start with question is what  is quantum mechanic what is quantum  entanglement  okay uh  quantum entanglement  uh started out with Schrodinger  Schrodinger produced not one but two  important equations  you started out with the first uh  equation  which was for single particles  the  particular hydrogen which has a single  electron  and he miraculously it described the  structure the structure and the energy  levels of hydrogen  but more complicated was helium which  had two electrons so he produces a a a  second uh  equation  which now involves  two electrons the two are very different  equations  the second one allows quantum  entanglement  which is a  new equate uh Solutions  emerged from from the second equation  and the  peculiarity is that the two electrons  are now intimately uh correlated  at the time nobody suggested doing any  experiments to test this rather bizarre  prediction however both Einstein and  Schrodinger were very disturbed by this  phenomenon  and in fact uh Einstein badalski Rosen  in 35  proposed the addition of additional  variables through quantum mechanics to  in order to explain what’s going on  Niels Bohr on the other hand said no  they’re not needed  and and I discussed all of this very  nicely  so one of the question first questions I  was asked when I was talking about this  in the uh Swedish Embassy uh a couple of  weeks ago  was  what is a bell inequality this is what  we in fact uh tested there’s not one but  there’s actually three important bill  inequalities that I want to talk about  the first of course was John Bell’s 1964  inequality  but uh uh and I’ll described very nicely  there’s one problem with  being of the theory  in order to be useful a theory must make  an experimental prediction and  unfortunately uh John Bell’s uh  uh paper made no experimental  predictions because it made demanded  a perfect experiment and uh which which  had certain uh certainty in the outcomes  and as  uh Ben Franklin pointed about the only  thing certain in life are or in nature  are death and taxes  unfortunately this is not Texas so the  uh  uh  with uh help from uh my associates uh  Mike Horn uh admir shimone and Dick Holt  who is here in the in the audience  uh  uh We’ve uh produced the uh closer horns  for money Holt now commonly referred to  as chsh inequality which was made the uh  first real testable experimental  prediction  so and we proposed a detailed experiment  to do that  and we noticed various important  loopholes uh one of which of course was  mentioned that he tested but a very  important loophole was that the data  really couldn’t violate the inequality  on their own so we had to add some  additional assumptions  so  the third inequality is now uh the was  uh produced by Mike horn and I uh in  1974 and it is the first loophole free  experimentally testable uh  uh inequality  okay let’s start with the first one uh  Atlanta’s already noticed this  I signed panelski Rosen had always and  and others had always assumed that that  quantum mechanics always made uh correct  predictions  the grand irony of this Bell’s paper  is that he showed  that Einstein’s original  intent of that paper was exactly the  opposite of what was true  that the if they wanted to show that  that the correct predictions led to  uh the need for hidden variables and  what bell showed was that if you put it  hidden variables in then you can’t get  the uh predictions of quantum mechanics  so again I said it was not really  testable  so uh  chsh in 1969  we were inspired by this work and said  wondered well this can we really relieve  the  get rid of Einstein’s requirement for a  perfect experiment and indeed we found  yes we could  and so we designed an experiment  uh to actually test it we worked out all  the details of what you uh you needed to  do in order to test it  uh and that was the first actual hard  experimental prediction  uh and it doesn’t you require uh bills  uh impossible to achieve its conditions  so uh we now have two theories two  different sets of predictions quantum  mechanics and bills uh the CH  inequalities prediction  so being an experimentalist let’s  actually do an experiment and find out  which one is true  so in order to do this we had to add a  minor supplementary conditions but they  were we believe that they’re of quite  reasonable rather weak  Okay the third inequality  is the  CH or the closer horn inequality that  was developed in 1974  uh and it was to test uh what is now  called local realism  we wanted to we wondered when we were  doing  the experiments  we wondered  what is really being tested here is it  just the addition of hidden variables or  is it something more profound than that  and we found that indeed it is far more  profound it was a test of Einstein’s  whole platform for doing physics  that we effectively were putting him out  of business  and so when we and in fact  the theory when we develop it was  effectively Dead on Arrival it was  already refuted  but nonetheless we tried to put it in as  clear as possible set of terms as we  could  so and in the process we formatted a new  inequality the CH inequality and it  allows loophole free tests  so uh now if with some even milder  additional assumptions then the first  experiments that uh that I had done uh  72 and 76 uh actually knocked it out so  that it was already dead  more recently and it’s taken a long time  because the technology did not exist at  all to in order to test it in 1974.  uh it has now been tested conclusively  with so now without any loopholes at all  one can say uh and I agree with the last  early uh conclusion it’s dead Jim  so  what are some of the experiments uh  there are three important ones that that  I did uh first was with Stu Friedman who  was a graduate student at UC Berkeley in  19 uh we published a results in 1972 and  this was the the first experiment to  actually test the chsh inequality  in the  in parallel with us  as Nicole I mentioned who is here was  working with Frank Pipkin at Harvard  and  they got the opposite result  oops one of us is is in trouble  so they decided not to publish they were  skeptical of their results  but now I’m skeptical of my results so  uh what do I do well I just decided Well  I needed to uh repeat uh their version  of the experiment which I did in 1976.  and then there’s just along the way  one of our assumptions had uh and I was  kind of searching for loopholes  uh had required photons to act like  particles but I discovered that there  was no actual experimentals uh proof  that that particles that photons did act  like particles so I did an experiment 74  to prove that okay so here is the the  first experiment  a picture of it and that all at the uh  right in it was a very young Stu  Friedman uh in the middle is a the  atomic beam apparatus sitting there  pumping away oil leaking all over the  floor  pair of polarizers on each side which  would which would rotate  so and this one became a stu Friedman’s  PhD thesis at uh  uh Cal Berkeley  so what we did is we had a calcium  Atomic beam and we excited it with this  UV lab very weak extension we wished  we’d had lasers which didn’t exist at  the time  so uh we got 6.3 Sigma result I mean the  five Sigma uh Criterion that is now  common was invented by Louis Alvarez at  Berkeley and he he uh was a a strong  Taskmaster on any experimental results  that came out of Berkeley  so  this was the the second experiment which  I did I mentioned uh this was a repeat  of the whole uh Pipkin experiment  I use the same polarizers but I used  their uh uh Source uh of mercury uh  foreign  the two photons  and Dick Hort uh hold uh very generously  taught me how to do it uh could not uh  there’s a it’s not an easy and that is  my Nobel artifact that I have donated is  one of the the sources  so it used Mercury uh with an electron  beam exciting yeah the atoms  and I got at least a four Sigma  result there  and we use this the same protocol in  order to uh introduce the the  assumptions  so the  other experiment that I mentioned  had to deal with it did particles was  there a real way  experimentally demonstrated wave  particle duality for photons  photons started in 1917  when Einstein was trying to explain  how do does a gas  and  a thermal uh applied spectrum of Life  come to equilibrium thermal equilibrium  with each other  and he noticed that  photons had to be behave by what he  called directional energy bundles  uh we now call them photons  then Schrodinger  noticed  that  what’s the difference between asking the  question well what’s the difference  between a particle and a wave  well a a wave could be just as a  classical pulse of light  and that is commonly referred to as the  old Schrodinger uh interpretation so how  does one tell tell them apart  suppose you have a source and you send  light through a half silver mirror  if it’s a wave  the wave will go both ways  reduced intensity  if it’s a particle  the particle will go  one way  or the other  now if I have two detectors  behind the uh  the half silvered mirror  if it’s a wave  they will both see this pulse and there  will be finite a probability that both  will register simultaneously  if it’s a particle only one of them  so how does one uh do that uh so  actually Schrodinger suggested this and  yannisi and uh Budapest actually tried  it but unfortunately they put in did an  inconclusive experiment so I went back  and started figured out how did one do  it totally conclusively and uh  so I did it actually where you’re using  the the same source that are used for  the uh producing  the for the Mercury uh bellotherm  experiment uh who had  photons going in both ways and two half  silver mirrors and using some a work  front by uh Glover’s formulation what  could show  that’s the The Coincidence rate between  here and here  there should be none of course if if  it’s a particle but but there should be  an anomalous if it’s a wave  uh a coincidence rate the product of  these two coincidence rates here and  here uh must be greater than  the the uh  Pro uh  the product of these coincidence rates  and so here’s the data and it’s quite  the opposite by about uh 20 Sigma  so indeed particles  to do act uh photons do act like  particles  so  as I mentioned before  Mike horn and I were trying to  understand what it is that  Bell’s theorem experiments actually say  so we developed What’s called the theory  of local realism  originally we called it objective local  theories uh in our first paper on it and  it’s an extremely general theory that  takes it to account all of the basic uh  elements of Einstein’s platform  and  uh  in along the way we produced the CH  inequality which is actually a hard  experimental prediction with no  loopholes we did not have any Assumption  of causality which we had earlier in  there was no Behavior requirement for a  particle like Behavior  uh and then there was some discussion  among various other workers John Bell  and admir shimoni added additional  components so presumably  uh it is better called Bill clauser Horn  shimoni local realism  it’s very short-lived as I mentioned it  was already Dead on Arrival  but that wasn’t good enough it had to  really be shown to be dead with no  loopholes  to it by testing  okay what does it assume  localism is extremely Simple Theory  Anton zeilinger and please quote me uh  tell me if if I am misquoting you at one  point he had a conference he said  if  Belle’s inequality  and local over realism had been  discovered  before quantum mechanics  it is so reasonable it would have been  taken as a law of nature or adapted as a  law of nature uh  unfortunately it’s wrong  so what does local realism assume  it assumes  that nature is made out of stuff  um well what is stuff well we we may not  even know what it is it is uh  it is what  I signed Podolski Rosen referred to as  elements of reality it’s what we call  matter or  uh uh What uh closer horn called objects  John Bell referred to it as beebles it’s  there it’s distributed throughout space  now actually Einstein’s whole program in  general as if any in particular goes a  lot further  and he said they said says that well it  has a finite mass energy density and it  it is that density that determines the  whole geometry of the universe  we don’t need that for local realism all  we need is that it’s there  so it could it could evolve  stochastically or it could evolve  uh deterministically we don’t care  it’s stuff  is stuff you can put in a box  you could uh throughout it and it’s the  stuff that’s in the Box  if you’re doing an experiment  the stuff determines the probabilities  of the experiment that you actually do  there  we assume that there are Real Results  the that happen when you do an  experiment  that is  uh  unlike uh Schrodinger actually he he  thought the whole idea of the The Cat In  The Box experiment was a total of  absurdity  we assume that the cat is either alive  or dead and we just don’t know which  that a real result always occurs  presumed that the properties of the  stuff  determine the results of an experiment  you do  the  if you have a parameter setting on your  apparatus  and then you change the parameter  setting presumably you will get a  different result  so what does it predict  well suppose you have two very widely  separated boxes each has stuff in it and  you’re doing experiments in these two uh  wide separated boxes  so you’ve hurt the Assumption the  following Einstein’s uh  requirement for locality is that stuff  in one box  and the out of the  parameter settings  uh the result of the experiment in one  box measuring that stuff cannot be  influenced by the parameter setting  Choice made in the distant box  that’s all you need to produce  uh  uh the uh  the closer horn inequality  okay so here’s what are boxes well  they’re just closed surfaces they  separate each closed surface separates  has a  an inside and an outside  so here we have a pair of boxes  okay these characters are uh well I made  that drawing in  1976 uh before the characters had been  named uh Alice and Bob well okay so this  but she but she perhaps trans I don’t  know  so what uh  here we have  Alice and Bob making measurements  and they get a result yes no on each  side  so we have our boxes here are now  shrinking at the speed of light  and so there’s drawn so that we’re doing  the experiments when there’s space like  separated  so if I plotted versus X and time  uh here are the boxes  shrinking  uh simultaneously and doing experiments  so the assumption is that stuff back  here in the common overlap region is  what is the result of of the extremist  if you read some of John Bell’s stuff  you have to be careful for some reason  he had these reverse he had the arrow of  time going to the left uh I’m sure he  had a reason for it but I don’t know  what it was  okay  it’s dead Jim  I apologize to Star Trek  who was for a long time it was very  difficult to do this the technology just  simply did not exist back in 74.  but it has improved  so  it became very important to eliminate  the loopholes in the earlier CH tests of  the chsh inequality and uh  to really do a loophole free experiment  and finally most recently at a labs in  Vienna  and in Champaign Urbana uh Illinois  uh  it has been totally killed dead  okay  now I will use what my time remaining  to make a  a value statement if you will about why  I have the fattest idea what’s going on  and I argue that in fact there’s been an  elephant in the room pardon the metaphor  that has been hanging around ever since  uh Schrodinger and epr  remember the trottinger produced two  very different equations  he had one for hydrogen with only a  single particle  and he had another one for helium which  had two particles  nobody seemed concerned at the time  about the fact that these two equations  were formulated in very different spaces  and they I are what I believe is  improperly linked and I’ll go on to that  in a minute by what I call borns  ambiguity born was the one who who said  that they are equivalent  and this this has been the elephant’s  been hiding in plain sight  and I noticed that in fact the Einstein  podolsky Rosen art debate a bore debate  was never really settled  various textbook authors  believed one or the other of the authors  and they’re developed in the literature  in the textbook industry two very  different schools of thought and  most people never seem to notice this  but  with the Advent of local realism and  quantum entanglement  then it became clear that one could  actually contrast and identify these two  schools of thought  okay School number one either is  essentially a form of local realism  so one of the textbooks that promote uh  uh uh the  School number one  it is what I call the laboratory space  formulation of quantum mechanics  okay it was taught you’re all I kind of  cut off the uh the list at about 1980  begin at first was born born’s textbook  two very important uh textbooks uh  familiar Dickie and whitkey and  mersbacher were very popular  uh all follow this uh  like for example inborn case  the waves are propagating in the lab and  he shows pictures of waves moving around  all of these books show waves in the it  was propagating through a two-slit  experiment in lab space  Feynman uh this is his review article  1948 even puts it into the title this is  a space-time uh operation French French  and Taylor uh using MIT and of course  the Original Classic shift  okay what is School number one  Quantum Mechanics for single particle  systems is formulated in lab space or  real space the XYZ of this room  and Heather is a point every point in  this lab space has a vector to it  and Schrodinger’s wave function is a  function of its position uh in the room  or in the lab  and more importantly  the probability density PSI star PSI  is a function of his position in the  room  it is  the evolution of  of these waves is governed by  Schrodinger’s equation in lab space  and it depicts waves of probability  you’ve probably heard any number of  people describe quantum mechanics says  waves the probability moreover there’s  also it’s defined by born a conserved uh  probability current which flows like a  fluid through through the lab  and he famously used that uh of current  to describe flux conservation  frieden Rutherford scattering  unfortunately  it only works the slab school of thought  number one only works for single  particle  systems it cannot describe  two particle systems or and it cannot  describe entanglement  so what’s goal number two  also had a large group of textbooks  which very specifically said we are in  configuration space  okay probably one of the most important  ones but beta and saw Peter with the  authoritative work on hydrogen and  helium Jordan and Drell relative is a  quantum mechanics caught in and shortly  uh  calculate Spectra of atoms  land down on lift shits great quantum  mechanics to expect it was translated by  John Bell actually and messiah’s famous  book  uh  except he he claims he’s in in  configuration space but actually he  cheats a bit  and probably most importantly fall was  Von Neumann’s textbook  okay what is  the configuration space  School  of quantum mechanics  it is a very very different from what I  just described  the wave function  depends on A System’s degrees of freedom  this Kim’s there could be many of them  uh there could be k degrees of some  large number k  and  so we have a wave function and these are  all this is straight out of Von  Neumann’s uh both  so if you have say two particles in  helium then  now the argument space of the wave  function is very different it has an x y  z of particle one XYZ of particle two  wait  our lab does not have six dimensions  something has dramatically changed  importantly  the  position in the lab  is not one of the arguments that means  that its value is the same everywhere is  base unlike the lab space formulation  that there were it’s different every  point in space  so Schrodinger’s equation now is very  different it’s divided describing the  evolution of particles in this  configuration space  it’s an abstract mathematical space  it is not at all this the space uh that  Star Trek was exploring  the a few important and it’s absolutely  required if you want to discuss more  than one particle systems  borns conserved currents  cannot be drawn in  a configuration space  Green’s theorem does not apply more  importantly  the there is no prohibition  for propagation of signals faster than  life in configuration space it’s a  purely  arbitrary space  totally as fact it’s what the  imaginations call a vector space not at  all  so  it was been asserted  and I as far as I could trace back this  was originally to to Bourne’s uh  dog that uh  these two cases are are the same  they are not  clearly the two uh wave functions are  very different they are not equivalent  one depends on the position of space one  does not there are no Associated  probability waves  for configuration space  so for my last slide I will describe why  I find this all totally confusing  you gotta have configuration space  in order to  describe more than one particle systems  but there’s no reason  uh that the special case of signal  particle systems should be any different  so you need a  so  and we notice really that the  lab space formulation is  uh  really a form of local realism  it’s dead Jim  so  now all of these great models  conceptual models of probability waves  propagating in space are also dead  the flow of currents probability  currents are dead  I don’t know how to visualize  propagation in configuration space  there are a lot of people here who know  a lot more quantum mechanics than I do  and maybe one of them will help me  understand  what does it mean to have a way of  propagating and configuration space I  don’t know uh thinking Wiki and Bruce  bucker were on my side they both said  gave up and said oh gee this is all our  our great models i.ei earlier uh  sections of the book we really should  throw throw away  so I have one final challenge  to my theorist friends if I still have  any  remember we said that that  general relativity  uh is a form of local realism  so and it is a general relativity that  for example gives us black holes  so  but that’s all formulated in  under a local realism Theory so my  challenge is to the theorists is it  possible to have two entangled black  hole spins  thank you </p>

The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bls.asp">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> calculates the CPI as a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp">weighted average</a> of prices for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket_of_goods.asp">basket of goods and services</a> representative of aggregate U.S. consumer spending.1</p>
<p>The CPI is one of the most popular measures of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111414/what-difference-between-inflation-and-deflation.asp">inflation and deflation</a>. The CPI report uses a different survey methodology, price samples, and index weights than the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ppi.asp">producer price index (PPI)</a>, which measures changes in the prices received by U.S. producers of goods and services.23</p>
<h3 id="KEY-TAKEAWAYS"><a href="#KEY-TAKEAWAYS" class="headerlink" title="KEY TAKEAWAYS"></a>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3><ul>
<li>The Consumer Price Index measures the overall change in consumer prices based on a representative basket of goods and services over time.</li>
<li>The CPI is the most widely used measure of inflation, closely followed by policymakers, financial markets, businesses, and consumers.</li>
<li>The widely quoted CPI is based on an index covering 93% of the U.S. population, while a related index covering wage earners and clerical workers is used for cost-of-living adjustments to federal benefits.</li>
<li>The CPI is based on about 80,000 price quotes collected monthly from some 23,000 retail and service establishments as well as 50,000 rental housing units.</li>
<li>Housing rents are used to estimate the change in shelter costs including owner-occupied housing that account for about a third of the CPI.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="The-Consumer-Price-Index"><a href="#The-Consumer-Price-Index" class="headerlink" title="The Consumer Price Index"></a>The Consumer Price Index</h4><h2 id="Understanding-the-Consumer-Price-Index-CPI"><a href="#Understanding-the-Consumer-Price-Index-CPI" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI)"></a>Understanding the Consumer Price Index (CPI)</h2><p>The BLS collects about 80,000 prices monthly from some 23,000 retail and service establishments. Although the two CPI indexes calculated from the data both contain the word urban, the more broad-based and widely cited of the two covers 93% of the U.S. population.43</p>
<iframe frameborder="0" src="https://3ee46c8e9908f7376a654f70e6df7862.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html" id="google_ads_iframe_3865/ddm.investopedia.com/ntv1_0" title="3rd party ad content" name="" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" width="0" height="346" data-is-safeframe="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" role="region" aria-label="Advertisement" tabindex="0" data-google-container-id="g" data-load-complete="true" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; min-width: 100%;"></iframe>

<p>Shelter category prices accounting for a third of the overall CPI are based on a survey of rental prices for 50,000 housing units, which is then used to calculate the rise in rental prices as well as owners’ equivalents.35</p>
<p>The owners’ equivalent category models the rent equivalent for owner-occupied housing to properly reflect housing costs’ share of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumer-spending.asp">consumer spending</a>.5 User fees and sales or excise taxes are included, while income taxes and the prices of investments such as stocks, bonds, or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifeinsurance.asp">life insurance policies</a> are not part of the CPI.3</p>
<p>The calculation of the CPI indexes from the data factors in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substitution-effect.asp">substitution effects</a>—consumers’ tendency to shift spending away from products and categories has grown relatively more expensive. It also adjusts price data for changes in product quality and features. The weighting of the product and service categories in the CPI indexes corresponds to recent consumer spending patterns derived from a separate survey.67</p>
<p>The CPI-U increased 3.0% over the 12-month period ending June 2023. That was an increase of 0.2% in June compared with a 0.1% increase in May 2023.8</p>
<h2 id="Types-of-Consumer-Price-Indexes-CPIs"><a href="#Types-of-Consumer-Price-Indexes-CPIs" class="headerlink" title="Types of Consumer Price Indexes (CPIs)"></a>Types of Consumer Price Indexes (CPIs)</h2><p>The BLS publishes two indexes each month. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpiu.asp">Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)</a> represents 93% of the U.S. population not living in remote rural areas. It doesn’t cover spending by people living in farm households, institutions, or on military bases. CPI-U is the basis of the widely reported CPI numbers that matter to financial markets.</p>
<p>The BLS also publishes the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cpi-w.asp">Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)</a>. The CPI-W covers 29% of the U.S. population living in households with income derived predominantly from clerical employment or jobs with an hourly wage.3</p>
<p>CPI-W is used to adjust Social Security payments as well as other federal benefits and pensions for changes in the cost of living.9 It also shifts federal income tax brackets to ensure taxpayers aren’t subjected to a higher marginal rate as a result of inflation.</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Formulas"><a href="#Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Formulas" class="headerlink" title="Consumer Price Index (CPI) Formulas"></a>Consumer Price Index (CPI) Formulas</h2><p>The more common CPI-U calculation entails two primary formulas. The first is used to determine the current cost of the weighted-average basket of products, while the second is used to analyze the year-over-year change.</p>
<h3 id="Annual-CPI-Formula"><a href="#Annual-CPI-Formula" class="headerlink" title="Annual CPI Formula"></a>Annual CPI Formula</h3><p>To calculate the annual CPI, the BLS divides the value of a specific basket of goods today compared to one year ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual CPI&#x3D;Value of Basket in Current YearValue of Basket in Prior Year×100Annual CPI&#x3D;Value of Basket in Prior YearValue of Basket in Current Year×100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the basket of goods and services used in the CPI calculation is a composite of popular items commonly purchased by Americans. The weight of each component of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basket.asp">basket</a> is in proportion to how they are sold. The annual CPI is reported as a whole number, and the figure is often greater than 100 (assuming current market prices are appreciating).</p>
<p>Then, the BLS uses the current year’s CPI and the prior year’s CPI to calculate the inflation rate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inflation Rate&#x3D;New CPI−Prior CPIPrior CPI×100Inflation Rate&#x3D;Prior CPINew CPI−Prior CPI×100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inflation rate can be calculated for a given month or annual period; in either case, the appropriate new and prior period must be selected. The inflation rate is reported as a percentage and is often positive (assuming current market prices are appreciating).</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Categories"><a href="#Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Categories" class="headerlink" title="Consumer Price Index (CPI) Categories"></a>Consumer Price Index (CPI) Categories</h2><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">monthly CPI release</a> from the BLS leads with the change from the prior month for the overall CPI-U as well as its key subcategories, along with the unadjusted change year-over-year. The BLS detailed tables show price changes for a variety of goods and services organized by eight umbrella spending categories.</p>
<p>Subcategories estimate price changes for everything from tomatoes and salad dressing to auto repairs and sporting events tickets. Price change for each subcategory is provided with and without <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/seasonal-adjustment.asp">seasonal adjustment</a>.10 In addition to the national CPI indexes, BLS publishes CPI data for U.S. regions, sub-regions, and major metropolitan areas. The metro data is subject to wider fluctuations and is useful mainly for identifying price changes based on local conditions.11</p>
<p>The table below represents the CPI basket weighted distribution amongst the eight major expense categories. Be mindful that some subcategories may be difficult to spot within their major categories. For example, automobiles are classified under commodities.12</p>

Businesses and consumers also use the CPI to make informed economic decisions. Since CPI measures the change in consumers’ purchasing power, it is often a key factor in pay negotiations. </p>
<h3 id="The-Federal-Reserve"><a href="#The-Federal-Reserve" class="headerlink" title="The Federal Reserve"></a>The Federal Reserve</h3><p>The Fed uses CPI data to determine economic policy. With a target inflation rate of 2%, the Fed may enact expansionary monetary policy to stimulate the economy should market growth slow, or enact contractionary monetary policy should the economy (and therefore prices) grow too quickly. In response to higher-than-desired inflation rates via the CPI, the Fed adjusts the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp">Fed funds rate</a>.13</p>
<h3 id="Other-Government-Agencies"><a href="#Other-Government-Agencies" class="headerlink" title="Other Government Agencies"></a>Other Government Agencies</h3><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cola.asp">cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)</a> based on the CPI affect federal payments to the approximately 70 million Americans receiving Social Security and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/ssi.asp">Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</a> benefits. They also apply to federal pension payments, school lunch subsidies, and income tax brackets.39</p>
<h3 id="Housing"><a href="#Housing" class="headerlink" title="Housing"></a>Housing</h3><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage-rates-5094943">Mortgage rates</a> (and other forms of long-term debt) are often impacted by rates set by government agencies. As the CPI increases and the government enacts policy changes to slow inflation, rates often increase. On the other hand, landlords may use CPI information to adequately assess what annual rent increases for renters should be.1415</p>
<h3 id="Financial-Markets"><a href="#Financial-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Financial Markets"></a>Financial Markets</h3><p>Financial market prices are driven by countless factors. One such factor is the CPI, as reactionary Fed policies directly impact economic growth, corporate profits, and consumer spending ability.3</p>
<p>A higher CPI often means that a less stringent government policy is generally in place. This means that debt is often easier to obtain for cheaper and that individuals have greater spending capacity. On the other hand, lower or decreasing CPI may indicate that the government may ease policy that helps boost the economy.</p>
<h3 id="Labor-Markets"><a href="#Labor-Markets" class="headerlink" title="Labor Markets"></a>Labor Markets</h3><p>The CPI and its components are also used as a deflator for other economic indicators, including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retail-sales.asp">retail sales</a> and hourly&#x2F;weekly earnings, to separate fundamental change from that reflecting change in prices. Employees may turn to CPI reports when approaching their employers for a raise based on nationwide increases in labor rates as well as pricing.16</p>
<p>Be mindful that the CPI is published using national data; employees may be more suited to using local data to better understand their specific situation. In addition, some workers covered by collective bargaining agreements may have their wages tied to changes in CPI.</p>
<h3 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h3><p>The BLS reports the CPI on a fixed, monthly cadence. A schedule of prior and future releases can be found on the BLS website, and the CPI is always released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.17</p>
<h2 id="Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-vs-Unemployment"><a href="#Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-vs-Unemployment" class="headerlink" title="Consumer Price Index (CPI) vs. Unemployment"></a>Consumer Price Index (CPI) vs. Unemployment</h2><p>In the broadest sense, the CPI and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment.asp">unemployment</a> rates are often inversely related. This is not always the case in every economy, but the Federal Reserve often attempts to decrease one metric while balancing the other. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve took unprecedented supervisory and regulatory actions to stimulate the economy.18</p>
<p>As a result, the labor market strengthened and returned to pre-pandemic rates by March 2022; however, this stimulus has resulted in the highest CPI calculations in decades.19</p>
<p>As a result of higher-than-targeted CPI calculations, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates and tapering certain asset purchases.20 On one hand, these measures aim to slow economic growth, make it more expensive for consumers to acquire debt, and stem monetary supply growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these additional expenses may burden households and make companies less profitable. All else being equal when the Federal Reserve attempts to lower the CPI, it runs the risk of unintentionally increasing unemployment rates.</p>
<h2 id="Critiques-of-Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Methodology"><a href="#Critiques-of-Consumer-Price-Index-CPI-Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Critiques of Consumer Price Index (CPI) Methodology"></a>Critiques of Consumer Price Index (CPI) Methodology</h2><p>Because the CPI Index is so crucial to economic policy and decision-making, its methodology has long been controversial, drawing claims it either understates or overstates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp">inflation</a>. A panel of economists commissioned by Congress to study the issue in 1995 concluded the CPI overstated inflation and was followed by calculation changes to better reflect substitution effects.21</p>
<p>More recently, critics have claimed that adjustments for changes in product quality and features understate the CPI. According to the BLS, the particularly controversial hedonic adjustments, which use regression techniques to adjust prices for new features on a relatively small proportion of the CPI items, have a net effect close to zero on the index.22</p>
<p>As the traditional CPI-U calculation only measures inflation for urban populations, it remains a less-than-reliable source of data for individuals living in rural areas. In addition, the CPI does not explicitly state how different demographics may be impacted by inflation. For example, soaring education costs may adversely impact younger individuals, while the impact of increasing elderly care costs is felt by a different group of individuals.</p>
<p>This notion is also widely attributable to individuals with varying degrees of income. For example, lower-income individuals who contribute more gross income towards necessities of shelter and food will skew differently than households with larger disposable income. For this reason, the CPI may not adequately reflect each individual’s experience in regard to costs and changes over time.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-the-Current-CPI"><a href="#What-Is-the-Current-CPI" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Current CPI?"></a>What Is the Current CPI?</h2><p>The annual change in the CPI was 3.0% for the 12-month period ending June 2023. This was a 0.2% increase from the previous month.8</p>

<h2 id="How-Is-the-CPI-Calculated"><a href="#How-Is-the-CPI-Calculated" class="headerlink" title="How Is the CPI Calculated?"></a>How Is the CPI Calculated?</h2><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics samples 80,000 prices monthly to calculate the CPI, weighing the index for each product or service in proportion to its share of recent consumer spending to calculate the overall change in prices. The calculation also factors in the substitution effect as consumers shift spending away from the products rising in price on a relative basis. The CPI also adjusts for changes in product quality and features. The numbers are provided with and without seasonal adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="What-Are-Some-Criticisms-of-the-CPI"><a href="#What-Are-Some-Criticisms-of-the-CPI" class="headerlink" title="What Are Some Criticisms of the CPI?"></a>What Are Some Criticisms of the CPI?</h2><p>Over the years, the CPI has frequently drawn criticism that it has either understated or overstated inflation. Because the CPI is based on consumer spending, it doesn’t track third-party reimbursements for healthcare and significantly underweights healthcare relative to its proportion in the GDP as a result. On the other hand, criticism concerning the quality adjustments used in the CPI has been widely discounted by economists.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The Consumer Price Index is an important economic metric. It measures the average change in prices paid by consumers over a period of time for a basket of goods and services. The index is calculated and published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is among the most common measures of inflation, indicating the health and direction of the economy. It also serves in other capacities, notably to help make adjustments to certain income payments, such as Social Security and pensions for federal civil service retirees.</p>

        <p>Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) Definition and How It Works<br>By THE INVESTOPEDIA TEAM<br>Investopedia logo<br>Full Bio</p>
<p>Investopedia contributors come from a range of backgrounds, and over 24 years there have been thousands of expert writers and editors who have contributed.</p>
<p>What Is the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)?<br>The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is an index of the prevailing direction of economic trends in the manufacturing and service sectors. It consists of a diffusion index that summarizes whether market conditions are expanding, staying the same, or contracting as viewed by purchasing managers. The purpose of the PMI is to provide information about current and future business conditions to company decision-makers, analysts, and investors.</p>
<p>KEY TAKEAWAYS<br>The Purchasing Managers Index is a measure of the prevailing direction of economic trends in manufacturing.<br>The PMI is based on a monthly survey of supply chain managers across 19 industries, covering both upstream and downstream activity.<br>The value and movements in the PMI and its components can provide useful insight to business decision makers, market analysts, and investors, and is a leading indicator of overall economic activity in the U.S.<br>Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)<br>Formula and Calculation of the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)<br>The PMI is calculated as: </p>
<p>PMI &#x3D; (P1 * 1) + (P2 * 0.5) + (P3 * 0)<br>Where:</p>
<p>P1 &#x3D; percentage of answers reporting an improvement<br>P2 &#x3D; percentage of answers reporting no change<br>P3 &#x3D; percentage of answers reporting a deterioration<br>Other companies also produce PMI numbers, including IHS Markit Group, which puts out the PMI for various countries outside the U.S.<br>How the PMI Works<br>The PMI is a key economic tool and is among the most reliable leading indicators of the U.S. economy. The index is reported by manufacturing and services. There is also a hospital PMI that is released on a monthly basis. The index sheds insight into the business environment and also helps companies get a grasp on where the economy is headed.</p>
<p>It is a survey-based indicator that is compiled and released each month by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). The survey is sent to senior executives at more than 400 companies in 19 primary industries, which are weighted by their contribution to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The surveys include questions about business conditions and any changes, whether they are improving or deteriorating, or have no changes. The PMI is based on five major survey areas—each of which is weighted equally:</p>
<p>New orders<br>Inventory levels<br>Production<br>Supplier deliveries<br>Employment<br>The headline PMI is a number from 0 to 100. A PMI above 50 represents an expansion when compared with the previous month. A PMI reading under 50 represents a contraction while a reading at 50 indicates no change. The further away from 50, the greater the level of change.</p>

<p>在此之前刚学五十音图里的几个hiragana，感觉日语学的好可以撩妹，因为喜欢二次元的妹子挺多的，但是学过brain science之后突然感觉撩妹变得有点无聊，我一下子就会想到她们的amigdala体，如果某个人的amygdala体受到破坏可能就会对性彻底失去兴趣，不过哪怕光光想想也会失去兴趣。</p>
<p>2023.7.29.</p>
<p>把日语的日程也加进来，挑战自己可以同时学多少东西</p>
<p>在这里尝试用romanji打一些日语字。切换语种模式的时候，会有可能会损耗一定能量，但是暴力地克服它也许会收获更多更有意思的东西.</p>

<p>Project for Sep.Memerizing all the hiragana. Project for Oct. Is memorizing all the katakana. Because I purely use my second language to learn Japanese now, I can hardly communicate some experience on learning it with a person using Chinese to learn it. For example, I only know hiragana and katakana, but I don’t know the correspondent in Chinese. .</p>

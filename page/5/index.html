Sabina protests, however, that her “enemy is kitsch, not Communism!” Mr Kundera, who died on July 11th aged 94, moved from a fervent youthful socialism to global renown as an exiled author who dissected and derided the follies and cruelties of the Soviet satellite regime that ruled his homeland until 1989. He insisted always, though, on the supremacy of art over any ideology, and championed the novelist’s vocation in an era “befogged with ideas and indifferent to works”.</p>
<p>For Mr Kundera, the deadly foe of truthful art was kitsch: the narcissistic sentimentality that, under any social system, effaces realities and encourages people to “gaze into the mirror of the beautifying lie”. With caustic irony, mordant wit and acrobatic literary skill, he mocked the beautifying lie wherever he found it—in politics, in culture or in personal relationships. Before and after the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Mr Kundera became one of the world’s best-known critics of the abstract idealism that can lead to tyranny. In agile, fragmentary, essay-like fictions, he took aim at the belief in history as a progressive “Grand March” towards “brotherhood, equality, justice, happiness”.</p>
<p>Yet his scorn for “totalitarian” idealists had its roots in his experience as one of them. Born in Brno in 1929 as a musician’s son, he studied literature in Prague; as communists took power in 1948, he produced poetry to glorify their revolution. “I too once danced in a ring,” he writes in “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting”. He too felt “the magic qualities of the circle”.</p>
<p>Soon, the circle broke. A gag that went wrong, commemorated in “The Joke”, led to his expulsion from the party in 1950. Although he returned to party loyalty for a while, and taught literature to film students in Prague, “The Joke”—published in 1967, then banned—set him on the road to official disgrace, dissidence and exile. Having understood “what it is for a man to live through the death of his nation” after the Soviet invasion in 1968, he lived in France from 1975. Later, he would write in French.</p>
<p>Playful, elusive, experimental, Mr Kundera eschewed not just the “Grand March” but the grand statement. “My lifetime ambition,” he told the <em>Paris Review</em>, “has been to unite the utmost seriousness of question with the utmost lightness of form.” Music, his first love, gave him a model. His novels consist of sets of variations (often in seven parts) composed in the vein he admired in the greatest central European writers: “the privileged sphere of analysis, lucidity, irony”.</p>
<p>After his breakthroughs with “The Book of Laughter and Forgetting” (1979) and “The Unbearable Lightness of Being” (1984), readers and writers around the world—from Philip Roth to Salman Rushdie—found in Mr Kundera a liberating inspiration. Sceptics deemed him chilly, manipulative, aloof. His cold-eyed, even abrasive, appraisal of both women’s and men’s romantic lives brought charges of misogyny. He revelled in not only “the undiscovered comic side to history” but also “the (hard-to-take) comic side of sexuality”.</p>
<p>Although later novels—he wrote ten—shrank in size and impact, he kept faith with the art of fiction. For Mr Kundera, the novelist is “neither historian nor prophet” but “an explorer of existence”. Fiction preserves reality in an age of oblivion, since “the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.” And humour gives fiction its resilience: not just funny turns, but an “unobtrusive light” that “glows over the vast landscape of life”. Its mortal foe, both in communist and consumerist society, will always be the dishonesty and phoney solidarity of kitsch. Against humourless sentimentalists and ideologists, novelists opened a realm of freedom and tolerance, Mr Kundera thought: a place “where no one owns the truth and everyone has the right to be understood.” </p>

        <p>在此整理一些《洛丽塔》相关的内容，一本我非常喜欢的作品</p>
<p>I have arranged the work the literature in the category of language, at. the first instinct I am going to feel that this is just so logical and inherent coherent because literature is absolutely a form a language right? But if you dare to think a little bit deeper you would understand that this is just not the case. But I will temporarily let it just be here. Maybe I am lazy and my head is now a slightly dizzing and I possess a feeling of uneasy and nausea but the level that gonna push in the largest extent.</p>
<p>Page 64( the one publsihed by penguin in 2015)some of the part of my fond or favorito(jajaja this is a spanish word)</p>
<p>Next day they drove downtown to buy thing needed for the camp: any wearable purchase worked wonders with Lo. She seemed her usual sarcastic self at dinner. Immediately afterwards, she went up to her room to plunge into the comic books acquired for rainy days at Camp Q(they were so thoroughly sampled ny Thursday that she left then behind ). I too tired to my lair(-), and wrote letters. My plan now was to leave for the seaside and then, whem school began, resume my existence in the Haze child. On Tuesday they went shopping again, and I was asked to answer the phone of the cap mistress rang up during there absence. She did, and a month or so laterwe had occasion to recall oue pleasant chat. That Tuesday, Lo had her dinner in her room. She had been crying after a routine row with her mother and, as had happened on former occasions, had not wished me to see her swollen eyes: she had one of those tender complexions that after a good cry get all blurred and inflamed, and morbid alluring. I regretted keenly her mistake about my private aesthetics, for I simply love that tinge of Bottceillian pink, that raw rose about the lips, those wet, matted eyelashes; and, naturally, her bashful whim deprived me of many opportunities of specious consolation. There was, however, more to it than I thought .As we sat in the darkness of the veranda( a rude wind that had put out her red candles), Haze, with a dreary laugh, said she had told Lo that her beloved humbert thoroughly approved of the whole camp idea “and now”, added Hazed, “ the child throws a fit:”pretext: you and I want to get rid of her: actual reason: I told her we could exchange tomorrow for a plainer stuff some much too cute night things that she bullied me into buying for her. You see, she sees herself as a starlet: I see her as sturdy, healthy, but decidedly homely kids. Thus I guess, is at the root of our troubles.</p>
<p>On Wednesday I managed to waylay Lo for a few seconds: she was on the landing, in sweatshirt and green-stained white shorts, rummaging, in a trunk. I said somehthing meant to be friendly and funny but she only emitted a snort without looking at me. Desperate, dying Humbert patted her clumsily on her coccyx</p>

<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p>*<em>^Lolita, or the Confession of a White Widowed Male,<strong><strong>n</strong> <strong>such were the two titles under wbicb the writer of the present note received the strange pages it preambulates. ^Humbert Humbert,</strong> <strong>”</strong> <strong>their author had died in legal captivity, of coronary thrombosis, on November i6</strong></strong>y</em>* <strong>1952, a fiw days before his trial was scheduled to start. His laivyer, my goodfriend and relation, Clarence Choate Clark, Esq., now of he Districf of Columbia bar, in asking me to edit the manuscript****t</strong> *<em>based his request on a clause in his client’s will which empowered wiy eminent cousin to use his discretion in all matters pertaining to the preparation cf^Lolittf for print. Mr. Claris decision may have been influenced by the fact that the editor ofhis choice hadjust been awarded the Poling Prize for a modest work (<strong><strong>tt</strong></strong>Do the Senses make Sensed) therein certain morbid states and perversions had been discussed.</em>*</p>
<p><strong>My task proved simpler than either of us had anticipated. Save for the correction cf obvious solecisms and a careful suppression of a fiw tenacious details that despite “H.H.</strong> <strong>m<strong><strong>s oivn efforts still subsisted in his text as signposts and tombstones (indicative cfplaces or persons that taste i^ould conceal and compassion spare), Ms remarkable memoir ispresented intact. Its author^ bizarre cognomen is his own invention; and, cf course, this mask</strong></strong>——****through which</strong> <strong>如。<strong><strong>hypnotic eyes seem to glow</strong></strong>——<strong><strong>had to remain unlifled in accordance u</strong></strong>妙</strong> <strong>its rearer’s uis” While</strong> <strong>tt<strong><strong>Haze</strong></strong>n</strong> <strong>only rhymes with the heroin^ real surname, her first name is too closely interwound with the inmost fiber cfthe book to allow one to alter it; nor (as the reader will perceive for himself) is there any practical necessity to do so. References to</strong> <strong>a****H.H.</strong> <strong>m****s crime may be looked up by the inquisitwe in the daily papers for September-October 1^2; its cause and purpose ^ould have continued to come under my reading lamp.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For the benefit cf old-fashioned readers</strong> 攻必。<strong>wish to follow the destinies cfthe</strong> <strong>v<strong><strong>real</strong></strong>n****people beyond, the</strong> <strong>U<strong><strong>true</strong></strong>n</strong> <strong>story, afiw details may be given as received from Mr. ‘“Windmuller^ of<strong><strong>tt</strong></strong>Ramsdale,</strong> <strong>fft****who desires his identity suppressed so that “the long shadow ofMs sorry and sordid business should not reach the community to which he is proud to belong. His daughter ‘’Louise^ is by no^ a college sophomore,</strong> <strong>u<strong><strong>Mona Dahl</strong></strong>n</strong> <strong>is a student in Paris.</strong> <strong>a<strong><strong>Rita</strong></strong>n</strong> <strong>has recently married the proprietor cf a hotel in Florida. Mrs. ^Richard F.

<p><strong>Viewed simply as a novel, ^Lolita’ deals with situations and emotions that would remain exasperatingly vague to the reader had their expression been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions.

<p><em><strong>*Part One*</strong></em></p>
<p>Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.</p>
<p>She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.</p>
<p>Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</p>
<p>Ladies and gendemen of the ju功 exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.</p>
<p><em><strong>*2*</strong></em></p>
<p>I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gende, easy-going person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to pass around in a minute some lovely; glossyblue picture-postcards. He owned a luxurious hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively; At thirty he married an English girl, daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two Dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjects—paleopedology and Aeolian harps, respectively; My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memo% over which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusl^ a furry warmth, golden midges.</p>
<p>My mothers elder sister; Sybil, whom a cousin of my fathers had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. I was extremely fond of her, despite the rigidity——the fatal rigidity—of some of her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the fullness of time, a better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had pink-rimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was poetically superstitious. She said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday and did. Her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in America, where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.</p>
<p>I grew, a happ% healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books, clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces. Around me the splendid Hotel Mirana revolved as a kind of private universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. From the aproned pot-scrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me, everybody petted me. Elderly American ladies leaning on their canes listed towards me like towers of Pisa. Ruined Russian princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. He, <strong>mon cher petit papa,</strong> took me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and water-ski, read to me <strong>Don Quixote</strong> and <strong>Les Miserable^</strong> and I adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever I overheard the servants discuss his various lady-friends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness.</p>
<p>I attended an English day school a few miles from home, and there I played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. The only definite sexual events that I can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday (that is, before I first saw my little Annabel) were: a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an American kid, the son of a then celebrated motion-picture actress whom he seldom saw in the three-dimensional world; and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and umbra, with infinitely soft partings, in Pichons sumptuous <strong>Le Beaute Humaine</strong> that that I had filched from under a mountain of marble-bound <strong>Graphics</strong> in the hotel library; Later, in his delightful debonair manner, my father gave me all the information he thought I needed about sex; this was just before sending me, in the autumn of 1923, to a <strong>lycee</strong></p>
<p>in Lyon (where we were to spend three winters); but alas, in the summer of that year; he was touring Italy with Mme de R. and her daughter, and I had nobody to complain to, nobody to consult.</p>
<p><em><strong>*3*</strong></em></p>
<p>Annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage: half-English, half-Dutch, in her case. I remember her features far less distinctly today than I did a few years ago, before I knew Lolita. There are two kinds of visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general terms as: ahoney-colored skin,” “think arms,” “brown bobbed hair,” “long lashes,” “big bright mouth”)； and the other when you instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita).</p>
<p>Let me therefore primly limit myself in describing Annabel, to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior. Her parents were old friends of my aunt’s, and as stuffy as she. They had rented a villa not far from Hotel Mirana. Bald brown Mr. Leigh and fat, powdered Mrs. Leigh (born Vanessa van Ness). How I loathed them! At first, Annabel and I talked of peripheral affairs. She kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers. Our brains were turned the way those of intelligent European pre adolescents were in our day and set, and I doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity solipsism and so on. The softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. She wanted to be a nurse in some famished Asiatic country; I wanted to be a famous spy</p>
<p>All at once we were madl% clumsily shamelessly agonizingly in love with each other; hopelessly I should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each others soul and flesh; but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do. After one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden (of which more later), the only privacy we were allowed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the <strong>plage.</strong> There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other: her hand, halShidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer; then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey; sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other’s salty lips; these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed at each other, could bring relief</p>
<p>Among some treasures I lost during the wanderings of my adult years, there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed Annabel, her parents and the staid, elderly; lame gentleman, a Dr. Cooper, who that same summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. Annabel did not come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending over her <strong>chocolat glace,</strong> and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified (as I remember that picture) amid the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded; but I, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, came out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness: a mood% beetle- browed boy in a dark sport shirt and well-tailored white shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away; That photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. Under the flimsiest of pretexts (this was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered) we escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebody s lost pair of sunglasses for only witness. I was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement, and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu.</p>
<p><em><strong>*4*</strong></em></p>
<p>I leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep asking myself was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the rift in my life began; or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity? When I try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. I am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel.</p>
<p>I also know that the shock of Annabels death consolidated the frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. The spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matter-of-fact, crude, standard-brained youngsters of today; Long after her death I felt her thoughts floating through mine. Long before we met we had had the same dreams. We compared notes. We found strange affinities. The same June of the same year (1919) a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. Oh, Lolita, had you loved me thus!</p>
<p>I have reserved for the conclusion of my “Annabel” phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst. One night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family; In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall. Through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory; appear to me now like playing cards一presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant s均 seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky; strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, half-pleasure, half-pain, came over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would bend with a sleep% soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again; and her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. She would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine; then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.</p>
<p>I recall the scent of some kind of toilet powder—I believe she stole it from her mother’s Spanish maid——a sweetish, lowly; musky perfume. It mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled to the brim; a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowing—and as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house her mother’s voice calling her, with a rising frantic note—and Dr. Cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. But that mimosa grove—the haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew; and the ache remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever since—until at last, twenty-four years later, I broke her spell by incarnating her in another.</p>
<p><em><strong>*5*</strong></em></p>
<p>The days of my youth, as I look back on them, seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was practical, ironical and brisk. While a college student, in London and Paris, paid ladies sufficed me. My studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry and many <strong>manque</strong> talents do; but I was even more <strong>manque</strong> than that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I switched to English literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds. Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the <strong>Deux Magpts.</strong> I published tortuous essays in obscure journals. I composed pastiches:</p>
<p>…Fraulein von Kulp</p>
<p>may turn, her hand upon the door;</p>
<p>I will not follow her. Nor Fresca. Nor</p>
<p>that Gull.</p>
<p>A paper of mine entitled “The Proustian theme in a letter from Keats to Benjamin Bailey” was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. I launched upon an <strong>a<strong><strong>Histoire abregee de la poesie anglaise</strong></strong>n</strong> for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of French literature for English-speaking students (with comparisons drawn from English writers) which was to occupy me throughout the forties一and the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.</p>
<p>I found a job一teaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I took advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.</p>
<p>Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than the&#x2F; reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as “nymphets.”</p>
<p>It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In fact, I would have the reader see “nine” and Ufourteenw as the boundaries—the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks—of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea. Between those age limits, are all girl-children nymphets? Of course not. Otherwise, we who are in the know we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and vulgarity or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes. Within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or “cute,”or even “sweet”and “attractive,wordinary plumpish, formless, cold-skinned, essentially human litde girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty (look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen). A normal man given</p>
<p>a group photograph of school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point out the comeli- est one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanendy aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs一the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate一the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; <strong>she</strong> stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten I should sa» generally thirty or fbrtj^ and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphets spell. It is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. When I was a child and she was a child, my little Annabel was no nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time; but today, in September 1952, after twenty-nine years have elapsed, I think I can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. We loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and survived; but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon I found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twenty- five to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-called normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts; inly I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a law-abiding poltroon I never dared approach. The human females I was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. I am ready to believe that the sensations I derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. The trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and I <strong>had,</strong> caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. My world was split. I was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine; both would be termed female by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my senses, uthey were as different as mist and mast.” All this I rationalize now In my twenties and early thirties, I did not understand my throes quite so clearly; While my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my bodys every plea. One moment I was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly optimistic. Taboos strangulated me. Psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudoli- bidoes.The fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of Annabels, her handmaids and girl-pages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. At other times I would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind my reader that in England, with the passage of the Children and Young Person Act in 1933, the term “girl-child” is defined as “a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years” (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is “young per- sorf,). In Massachusetts, U.S., on the other hand, a “wayward child”is, technically one “between seven and seventeen years of age” (who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of James the Rrst, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. This is all very interesting, and I daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures. Here is Virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lads perineum. Here are two of King Akhnatens and Queen Nefer- titi’s pre-nubile Nile daughters (that royal couple had a litter of six), wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. Here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain East Indian provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. After all, Dante fell madly in love with Beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely; and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in the merry month of May; And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hills of Vaucluse.</p>
<p>But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be good. Really and trul% he id. He had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability and under no circumstances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a <strong>row.</strong> But how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon child,<strong>u****enfant charmante etfourbe^</strong> dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. So life went. Humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for. The bud-stage of breast development appears early (10.7 years) in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. And the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair (11.2 years). My little cup brims with tiddies.</p>
<p>A shipwreck. An atoll. Alone with a drowned passengers shivering child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvelous were my fancied adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old trees shadow and sheen. Once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and tighten the strap of her roller skate, and I dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf^ as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. Another time a red-haired school girl hung over me in the metro, and a revelation of axillary russet I obtained remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great number of these onesided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell. It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. But abruptly fiendishly the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamp- lit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.</p>
<p>Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench, on my rack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble), and asked if I had stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play around me forever. Never grow up.</p>
<p><em><strong>*6*</strong></em></p>
<p>A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later? In this wrought-iron would of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I had possessed her—and she never knew it. All right. But would it not tell sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.</p>
<p>I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely^ maddening, thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine. A short slim girl passed me at a rapid, high-heeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round litde face French girls so often have, and I liked her long lashes and tight-fitting tailored dress sheathing in pearl-gray her young body which still retained—and that was the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loins—a childish something mingling with the professional <strong>fretillement</strong> of her small agile rump. I asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision (a bird, a very bird!) <strong>u<strong><strong>CenL</strong></strong>n</strong> I tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy); and with one beat of her lashes: <strong>u****7antpis^</strong> she said, and made as if to move away; Perhaps only three years earlier I might have seen her coming home from school! That evocation settled the matter. She led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the <strong>monsieur</strong> who might not care to meet another <strong>monsieur****y</strong> on the mournful climb to the abject room, all bed and <strong>bidet. As</strong> usual, she asked at once for her ?我衫 <strong>cadeau****y</strong> and as usual I asked her name (Monique) and her age (eighteen). I was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. They all answer <strong>u****dix- huif</strong>—a trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per da% the poor little creatures. But in Moniques case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. This I deduced from many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard below; When I examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown “O勿公 <strong>ce rfestpas bien^</strong> and went to the wash-basin, but I said it did not matter, did not matter at all. With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and indeed this is the reason why I linger gratefully in that gauze- gray room of memory with litde Monique) that among the eighty or so <strong>grues</strong> I had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. <strong>^Iletait malin, celui qui a invents ce truc-la^</strong> she commented amiably and got back into her clothes with the same high-style speed.</p>
<p>I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had never <strong>pose un lapin</strong> in all her young life. We returned to the same room, and I could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely: <strong>“Tues bien gentil de dire</strong> p?” and then, noticing what I noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small Eden——the dreadful grimace of clenched-teeth tenderness that distorted my mouth—dutiful little Monique (oh, she had been a nymphet, all right!) wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips <strong>avant qiion se couche</strong> in case I planned to kiss her. Of course, I planned it. I let myself go with her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a gaiety that I find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty I gave her as she trotted out into the April night drizzle with Humbert Humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping before a window display she said with great gusto: <strong>u****Je vais niacheter des basV</strong> and never may I forget the way her Parisian childish lips exploded on <strong>a****bas^</strong> pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the “a” into a brief buoyant bursting “o” as in <strong>“bof.</strong></p>
<p>I had a date with her next day at 2.15 p.m. in my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heart-rending fantasies and</p>
<p>peter out in dull disappointment. So let her remain, sleek, slender Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a delinquent nymphet shining through the matter-of-fact young whore.</p>
<p>My brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave da% in the office of a Mlle Edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album <strong>Regardez-moi cette belle brunet).</strong> When I pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door; however, after asking me what price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person <strong>quipourrait arranger la chose.</strong> Next da% an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky; with an almost farcical Provencal accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where a large and unfas- tidious family usually slept. It was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with red-ribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. When I shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess* torso; then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded <strong>son ardent.</strong> A door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police, <strong>lui****y</strong> so that I had better do as I was told. I went up to Marie—for that was her stellar name—who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. With a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave.</p>
<p><em><strong>*7*</strong></em></p>
<p>I do not know if the pimps album may not have been another link in the daisy-chain; but soon after, for my own safety I decided to marry. It occurred to me that regular hours, home-cooked meals, all the conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. A little money that had come my way after my fathers death (nothing very grand—the Mi- rana had been sold long before), in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks, allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. After considerable deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a Polish doctor: the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and tachycardia. We played chess; his daughter watched me from behind her easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. Let me repeat with quiet force: I was, and still am, despite <strong>mes malhenrs^</strong> an exceptionally handsome male; slow-moving, tall, with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor. Exceptional virility often reflects in the subject^ displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal. And this was my case. Well did I know alas, that I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female I chose; in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. Had I been <strong>^fran^ais moyen</strong> with a taste for flashy ladies, I might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than X^leria. My choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as I realized too late, a piteous compromise. All of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor Humbert always was in matters of sex.</p>
<p><em><strong>*8*</strong></em></p>
<p>Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified <strong>pot-au- fiu,</strong> an animated merkin,what really attracted me to Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She gave it not because she had divined something about me; it was just her style—and I fell for it. Actually she was at least in her late twenties (I never established her exact age for even her passport lied) and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed <strong>a la gamine^</strong> showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.</p>
<p>After a brief ceremony at the <strong>mairie****9</strong>1 tool her to the new apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear; before I touched her, a girls plain nightshirt that I had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But reality soon asserted itself The bleached curl revealed its melanic root; the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin; the mobile moist mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama; and presently instead of a pale litde gutter girl, Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, short-legged, big-breasted and practically brainless <strong>baba.</strong></p>
<p>This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat: two rooms, a hazy view in one window a brick wall in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. We had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her <strong>Paris-Soir****f</strong> I working at a rickety table. We went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. I appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. The grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad; but with Valerias help I did find after all some legal oudets to my fantastic predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly dismissed <strong>pot-au-feu</strong> and had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inlg blue, ancient American estampe一a locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of spark- studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.</p>
<p>These burst. In the summer of 1939 <strong>mon oncle d’Amerique</strong> died bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition I came to live in the States and showed some interest in his business. This prospect was most welcome to me. I felt my life needed a shake-up. There was another thing, too: moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. During the last weeks I had kept noticing that my fat 切ileria was not her usual self; had acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. When I informed her we were shortly to sail for New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There were some tedious difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better say Nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husbands solid Swiss citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the necessity of queuing in the <strong>prefecture^</strong> and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her America, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy Paris.</p>
<p>We were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. She answered (I translate from her French which was, I imagine, a translation in its turn of some Slavic platitude): aThere is another man in my liW</p>
<p>Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. A mounting fury was suffocating me一not because I had any particular fondness for that figure of fun, <strong>Mme Humbert^</strong> but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, Valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. I demanded her lover’s name. I repeated my question; but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce. <strong>u****Mais qui est-ce^</strong> I shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pulled up at a small cafe and introduced himselE I do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years I still see him quite clearly—a stocky White Russian ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut; there were thousands of them plying that fools trade in Paris. We sat down at a table; the Tsarist ordered wine, and X^leria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking——<strong>into</strong> me rather than to me; she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected she had in her. And every now and then she would volley a burst of Slavic at her stolid lover. The situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxi-colonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold <strong>his</strong> views and plans. With an atrocious accent to his careful French, he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one; and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, I can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. “I think,”一he said, “She will like <strong>Jean Christophe?’</strong> Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich.</p>
<p>I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few belongings immediately upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state, he drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked, and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether Humbert Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. I remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days (I have not spoken of them, I think, but never mind) when I toyed with the idea of enjoying his litde sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow and then shooting myselE I now wondered if Wlechka (as the colonel called her) was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. She had very vulnerable legs, and I decided I would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.</p>
<p>But we never were. Alechka—by now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow make-up,—started to fill anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a run-</p>
<p>ning kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. I cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary he displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a discreet old-world civility punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies <strong>(j’ai demande pardonne</strong>—excuse me——<strong>est-ce que fai puis</strong>一may I一and so forth), and turning away tactfully when Valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub; but he seemed to be all over the place at once, <strong>legredin,</strong> agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. I sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. At last both were out of the quivering apartment——the vibration of the door I had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English toilet water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine with a sogg}^ tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and I wildly looked around for a weapon. Actually I daresay it was nothing but middle-class Russian courtesy (with an oriental tang, perhaps) that had prompted the good colonel (Maximovich! his name suddenly taxies back to me), a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his hosts domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. But this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom. Then, canceling my search, I dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted; despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but broad-shouldered Maximovich seemed made of pig iron. The void of the street, revealing nothing of my wifes departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But no matter. I had my litde revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told me one day that Mrs. Maximovich nee Zbo- rovski had died in childbirth around 1945; the couple had somehow got over to California and had been used there, for an excellent salary; in a year-long experiment conducted by a distinguished American ethnologist. The experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. My infonnant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel, by then gray-haired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the well-swept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms (fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on) in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the results of these tests in the <strong>Review of Anthropology^</strong> but they appear not to have been published yet. These scientific products take of course some time to fluctuate. I hope they will be illustrated with photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. The one to which I am restricted these days, despite my lawyer’s favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison Ebraries. They have the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set, N.Y., G.W. Dillingham, Publisher, MDCCCLXXXVII); and the <strong>Childrens Encyclopedia</strong> (with some nice photographs of sunshine-haired Girl Scouts in shorts), and <strong>A Murder Is Announced</strong> by Agatha Christie; but they also have such coruscating trifles as <strong>A vagabond in Italy</strong> by Percy Elphinstone, author of <strong>Venice Revisited,</strong> Boston, 1868, and a comparatively recent (1946) <strong>Who’s Who in the Limelight</strong>—actors, producers, playwrights, and shots of static scenes. In looking through the latter volume, I was treated last night to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets love. I transcribe most of the page:</p>
<p>Pym, Roland. Born in Lundy; Mass., 1922. Received stage training at Elsinore Playhouse, Der切 N.Y. Made debut in Sunburst. Among his many appearances are <strong>Two Blocks from Here, The Girl in Green, Scrambled Husbands, The Strange Mushroom, Touch and Go, John Lovely, I Was Dreaming cfYou.</strong></p>
<p>Quilty; Clare, American dramatist. Bom in Ocean Cit^ N.J., 1911. Educated at Columbia University; Started on a commercial career but turned to playwriting. Author of <strong>The Little Nymph&gt; The Lady Who Loved Lightning</strong> (in collaboration with Vivian Darkbloom), <strong>Dark Age****t</strong> <strong>The strange Mushroom, Fatherly Love^</strong> and others. His many plays for children are notable. <strong>Little Nymph</strong> (1940) traveled 14,000 miles and played 280 performances on the road during the winter before ending in New Yjrk. Hobbies: fast cars, photography pets.</p>
<p>Quine, Dolores. Born in 1882, in Dayton, Ohio. Studied for stage at American Academy; First played in Ottawa in 1900. Made New ^ork debut in 1904 in <strong>Never Talk to Strangers.</strong> Has disappeared since in [a list of some thirty plays follows].</p>
<p>How the look of my dear loves name even affixed to some old hag of an actress, still makes me rock with helpless pain! Perhaps, she might have been an actress too. Born 1935. Appeared (I notice the slip of my pen in the preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence) in <strong>The Murdered Playwright.</strong> Quine the Swine. Guilty of killing Quilty; Oh, my Lolita, I have only words to play with!</p>

<p>在此之前刚学五十音图里的几个hiragana，感觉日语学的好可以撩妹，因为喜欢二次元的妹子挺多的，但是学过brain science之后突然感觉撩妹变得有点无聊，我一下子就会想到她们的amigdala体，如果某个人的amygdala体受到破坏可能就会对性彻底失去兴趣，不过哪怕光光想想也会失去兴趣。</p>

<p>把日语的日程也加进来，挑战自己可以同时学多少东西</p>
<p>在这里尝试用romanji打一些日语字。切换语种模式的时候，会有可能会损耗一定能量，但是暴力地克服它也许会收获更多更有意思的东西.</p>

<p>Project for Sep.Memerizing all the hiragana. Project for Oct. Is memorizing all the katakana. Because I purely use my second language to learn Japanese now, I can hardly communicate some experience on learning it with a person using Chinese to learn it. For example, I only know hiragana and katakana, but I don’t know the correspondent in Chinese. .</p>

<p>Uy, joe que me mato.</p>
<p>Oops, I almost killed myself.</p>
<p>Antes de ir a la playa, yo creo que- Yo creo que voy a barrer el patio un poco.</p>
<p>Before we go to the beach, I think I’ll- I think I’ll sweep the yard a bit.</p>
<p>Cuando volvamos de la playa, va a estar esto lleno de flores otra vez.</p>
<p>When we get back from the beach, this will be full of flowers again.</p>
<p>(No tanto pero).</p>
<p>(Not that much but).</p>
<p>Bueno por la tarde.</p>
<p>Well, in the afternoon.</p>
<p><em>barriendo</em></p>
<p><em>sweeping</em></p>
<p>Dame el recogedor.</p>
<p>Give me the dustpan.</p>
<p>Este es el recogedor y esta es la escoba.</p>
<p>This is the dustpan and this is the broom.</p>
<p>La escoba y el recogedor.</p>
<p>The broom and dustpan.</p>
<p>Bueno más o menos, para que cuando volvamos y nos demos una ducha,</p>
<p>Well, more or less, so that when we come back and take a shower,</p>
<p>que la ducha está aquí es esto de aquí.</p>
<p>the shower is here, it’s right here.</p>
<p>Pues no esté todo lleno de flores, por lo menos por esta zona.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not all full of flowers, at least in this area.</p>
<p>Voy a coger mi toalla… Bueno en realidad la puedo dejar aquí, sí total.</p>
<p>I’m going to take my towel… Well actually I can leave it here, yeah.</p>
<p>Dejo ahí mi toalla, cojo mi bañador y me voy a preparar para la playa.</p>
<p>I’ll leave my towel there, I’ll grab my swimsuit and I’m going to get ready for the beach.</p>
<p>¡Vamos allá!</p>
<p>Let’s go!</p>
<p>Aquí todas las casas, en Mazarrón se parecen mucho: tienen el patio delantero,</p>
<p>Here, all houses in Mazarrón are very similar: they have a front patio,</p>
<p>la casa, y luego tienen un patio trasero.</p>
<p>the house, and then they have a backyard.</p>
<p>¡Ay que me mato!</p>
<p>Oh, I almost kill myself!</p>
<p>¿Hacemos todo el camino de vuelta? En plan…</p>
<p>Shall we go all the way back? Like …</p>
<p>¿Giramos por aquí y vamos hasta Gela a ver si esta?</p>
<p>Shall we turn around here and go to Gela’s to see if she’s there?</p>
<p>Sí.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>La verdad es que es muy “aesthetic” esta… (calle).</p>
<p>Too be honest this… (street) is very “aesthetic”.</p>
<p>La verdad es que es muy “aesthetic” esta… (calle). Sí.</p>
<p>Too be honest this… (street) is very “aesthetic”. Yes.</p>
<p>Está cristalina el agua, no parece esto ni Mazarrón, ni domingo.</p>
<p>The water is crystal clear, it doesn’t look like this is, neither Mazarrón, nor Sunday.</p>
<p>Hola buenas. (Hola, ¿qué tal?) Bien.</p>
<p>Hi there. (Hello, how are you?) Good.</p>
<p>(Bien el verano, ¿no?) ¡Sí!</p>
<p>(Everything goos this summer, right?) Yes!</p>
<p>Porque está bastante vacío esto, bueno la playa no está vacía. La playa está llena.</p>
<p>Os queríamos preguntar si podíamos dejar- Porque estoy grabando un vídeo, pero no me fío de dejar las cosas-</p>
<p>We wanted to ask you if we could leave- Because I’m recording a video, but I don’t trust leaving our things-</p>
<p>Calla-</p>
<p>Shut up-</p>
<p>No me fío de dejar las cosas en la playa, entonces por si podíamos dejarlo aquí.</p>
<p>I don’t trust leaving our things on the beach, so I was wondering if we could leave them here.</p>
<p>(Como queráis). Genial, pues nada. :)</p>
<p>(As you wish). Great, well then. :)</p>
<p>aquí a esta roca.</p>
<p>here on this rock.</p>

<p>Tenemos un sonido de fondo de las olas muy relajante.</p>
<p>We have the very relaxing background sound of the waves.</p>
<p>Esta playa de aquí se llama La Playa de la Isla, porque eso es una isla.</p>
<p>This beach here is called La Playa de la Isla, because that is an island.</p>
<p>La verdad que, uno de los puntos fuertes de Mazarrón, uno de los puntos fuertes positivos es conocer a tanta gente,</p>
<p>The truth is, one of the strongest points of Mazarrón, one of it’s positive strengths is knowing so many people,</p>
<p>o tener a tanta familia en el mismo sitio se hace más divertido que si no conocieras a nadie.</p>
<p>or having a lot of family in the same place, it makes it more fun than if you didn’t know anyone</p>
<p>Gela no es familia, pero Gela como si lo fuera, porque es amiga de toda la vida de mi madre.</p>
<p>Gela is not family, but Gela as if she were, because she is a childhood friend of my mother’s.</p>
<p>La verdad es que tienen una casa aquí delante de la playa, literalmente a tres pasos,</p>
<p>To be honest they have a house here in front of the beach, literally three steps away,</p>
<p>que es una, es una maravilla. Es una maravilla.</p>
<p>which is just, it’s wonderful. It’s wonderful.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias! (A que estaba buena). Estaba buenísima, estaba muy buena,</p>
<p>Thank you very much! (It was good, right?). It was great, it was very good,</p>
<p>En la playa siempre entra súper bien la fruta. Vamos a coger nuestro bolso y nos vamos a…</p>
<p>Fruit always tastes better on the beach. We’re going to grab our bag and go to…</p>
<p>(¿a dónde os vais?) A casa. (¿Ya?) Os dejamos tranquilos.</p>
<p>(where are you going?) Home. (Already?) We’ll leave you alone.</p>
<p>Hale, muchas gracias, muchas gracias por la fruta también. ¡Chao!</p>
<p>There, thank you very much, thank you very much for the fruit too. Bye!</p>
<p>Este caminito de aquí lo llevamos haciendo toooda, toda la vida para ir y venir a la playa.</p>
<p>We’ve been walking this path here all our lives to go to and from the beach.</p>
<p>Que la playa la que hemos ido hoy no es a la que vamos siempre.</p>
<p>Since the beach be that we have gone to today is not where we usually go.</p>
<p>Hoy hemos ido a esa playa para dejar las cosas en la casa de Gela y que no nos las roben.</p>
<p>Today we went to that beach to leave our things at Gela’s house so they don’t get stolen.</p>
<p>Abre… la puerta. Abre la otra puerta.</p>
<p>Open the door. Open the other door.</p>
<p>En esta casa estamos con llaves para arriba para abajo todo el día.</p>
<p>In this house we are always messing around with keys.</p>
<p>Tenemos que limpiar el suelo porque si no luego cuando nos damos una ducha,</p>
<p>We have to clean the floor because if not then when we take a shower,</p>
<p>Todo- Se quedan las flores mojadas y luego es un rollo de limpiar y de recoger.</p>
<p>Everything- The flowers stay wet and then it’s a hassle to clean and pick up.</p>
<p>Tenemos aquí nuestras esponjas, el jabón, este es el acondicionador, este es el champú.</p>
<p>We have here our sponges, the soap, this is the conditioner, this is the shampoo.</p>
<p>Está todo listo para nuestra ducha.</p>
<p>Everything is ready for our shower.</p>
<p>Mira que me he puesto suavizante, me he puesto champú y suavizante.</p>
<p>Even though, I’ve used conditioner, I’ve used shampoo and conditioner.</p>
<p>Pero aún así, (au) mirad estos enredos. Estos son enredos.</p>
<p>Tampoco tengo mucho pelo, pero lo que tengo, cuando me cepillo me lo quito porque total-</p>
<p>I don’t have much hair either, but what I do have, when I brush it I pull it off because damn-</p>
<p>Bueno, más o menos. Y ahora toca hacer la comida.</p>
<p>Well, more or less. And now it’s time to cook.</p>
<p>Necesitamos: tomates, cinta de lomo, queso, gazpacho.</p>
<p>We need: tomatoes, tenderloin, cheese, gazpacho.</p>
<p>Gazpacho y ya está, esa es la comida.</p>
<p>Gazpacho and that’s it, that’s the food.</p>
<p>:o – pan</p>
<p>:o – bread</p>
<p>But still, (ouch) look at these tangles. These are tangles.</p>
<p>I don’t have much hair either, but what I do have, when I brush it I pull it off because damn-</p>
<p>A lo mejor le digo a María que vaya por pan, es una buena idea.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll tell Maria to go get some bread, that’s a good idea.</p>
<p>Vale, yo diría que la parte 1 del menú: ensalada de tomates, ya está lista.</p>
<p>Okay, I’d say the menu’s part 1: tomato salad, that’s it.</p>
<p>Un poco más de sal.</p>

<p>A mí es que me gustan las cosas bien saladas. Y ahora:</p>

<p>Cambio de planes</p>
<p>Change of plans</p>
<p>Pues he hecho una ensalada de tomate pero puedo… Podemos llevarla perfectamente.</p>
<p>Sí, ha dicho que nos la traigamos y ha dicho: Bueno, si no para la cena. Y yo: oye, también.</p>
<p>Además yo tengo tengo unas ganas de paella que me muero si te digo la verdad.</p>
<p>Llevo- Llevo muchísimo tiempo sin tomar paella, llevo un año fuera.</p>
<p>I’ve- I haven’t had paella for a long time, I’ve been out for a year.</p>
<p>Vale pues, recoges tú por allí yo voy a comprar el pan y el colorante que ahora me–</p>
<p>Okay then, you pick up over there I’m going to buy the bread and the coloring that now I–</p>
<p>Igual te llamo preguntándote a ti también el colorante.</p>
<p>I’ll call you anyway asking you about the coloring too.</p>
<p>y ahora… Ahora te veo. No sé si en casa o aquí, pero te veo.</p>
<p>and now… I’ll see you now. I don’t know if at home or here, but I’ll see you.</p>

        <p>在此记录学习小号的日常</p>
<p>2023.7.22.</p>
<p>现在我明白了吹奏小号的相关技术要求，主要是腹式呼吸，唇振，指法。</p>
<p>腹式呼吸：我现在可以理解腹式呼吸的物理原理，并且可以做到它，虽然非常不熟练。腹式呼吸是一种非常好玩的东西，不太确定最早是谁想到的，当然也有可能不是某个个人。</p>
<p>唇振：我明白小号的发声原理，是通过振动嘴唇，并且通过控制嘴唇的振动频率来使小号内的空气共振放大音量同时控制音高，大概是这样（但我不清楚为什么装上号嘴以后只能发出特定的音，好像是do，fa，si），但我无法控制好振动嘴唇的技巧，所以发出的音非常难听并且难以控制。</p>
<p>指法：几乎可以说是小号演奏整体要求中最为容易的那一个</p>
<p>循环换气：可以理解原理，高阶技能，暂时不用太关心。</p>
<p>我想我很快就需要再去杭州，这次认真地和葛老师学习吹奏，当我一旦进入到一个可以享受演奏的状态时，我应当就可以非常顺滑的快速上升了，并且也许会在吹奏一段时间小号以后接触其他一些管乐器。</p>
<p>2023.7.25.</p>
<p>昨天晚上第二次来杭州，晚上和葛老师学习，然后葛老师带我找那个嘴唇的感觉，我很快（至少比我自己）就几乎摸索到那个感觉， 但是正如我的形容一样，它确实很需要感觉，然后找到感觉如果一会忘了就要再找回来，那个嘴唇的振动的非常微妙的状态。然后感觉葛老师是一个非常有激情的人，非常投入（truly devoted，让我想起了gustavel dudamel对Claudio abbado的形容）。</p>
<p>2023.7.26.</p>
<p>诶呀，我搞错了以为后天是星期三（上课），原来明天就是星期三了，然后葛老师要我早上就去，现在已经凌晨一点了，我还在拼命的学自己的东西，刚刚刚学了50个西班牙语词汇，白天看了Nancy Kanwisher的脑科学感觉无比神奇和几乎震撼。然后没有太吹小号，在旅馆里不敢吹太大声，总是会感觉紧张，这样的话吹奏的时候真的非常的不舒服，我想找一个很好的环境，没有什么人的，也不会太热和蚊子。我觉得地下室不错，等我回家了晚上我到地下停车场去练。如果不是记错了，以为后天上课的话我现在正在电影院里看奥本海默，可以大陆院线应该没有无无字幕版的，如果看的时候有字幕会让我觉得非常非常难受。</p>
<p>2023.7.27.</p>
<p>昨天和葛老师继续学习小号（上一个daily是凌晨写的，所以是26号），非常欣喜，感觉我几乎是突飞猛进了，昨天我已经可以做到想吹哪个音就吹哪个音（可能会不稳，吃力不熟练，但是已经非常棒了因为我才和葛老师学习第二课，之前这个东西已经阻碍了我几乎一个月），昨天我可以单用号嘴吹出两支老鼠（我的大脑是如何判断这是”两只老鼠”的？“两只老鼠”在我的脑子里是什么？）。昨天真的巨开心，但是今天我又吹不出来了，其实今天还没怎么吹。明天早上和何老师学习，我想和他学习一点能让我把那台琴用起来的东西，至少可以让我对那台琴产生某种需求。因为当我对它产生需求，我就不需要刻意被动地练习它。</p>
<p>2023.7.29.</p>
<p>我要在音乐上做一个剥离的手法，我忘记了，我要做的剥离的手法就是在这个东西上变得纯粹的自私或者自我，当我真正自私的只为自我而创造某种东西才能完全投入和方松,剥离就是忘记忘掉一切他人的感受想法，完全只服从自我的内心来找寻,剥离掉原先依附在我身上的一些肮脏沉重的束缚,忘记他人的感受并不是不听老师的话的意思，是老师以外，或者真正喜欢它以外的一些无聊的人，一些圈子，也是牢笼，太多的人被它所束缚和桎梏了,回到最原始，最本源，最纯粹，天真无邪的那个状态里去，那是最有激情和真诚的状态。</p>

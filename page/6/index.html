        <p>这是我到目前为止学习的最深入和认真的一个物理属下的学科了。 学习它的原因是因为我对于可控，可理解深层逻辑的追求和好奇。 我逐渐感知到宏观世界，比如我和别人在交谈时发生的事情，比如一个人身体上发生的事情可以说是完全没有办法理解的时候，我产生了一种想要感知和把握可控可理解事物的欲望， 而想到这种可控可理解事物的时候，我自然地想到了更为微小，微观的事物，比如原子。 如同拉普拉斯所设想的，假如可以知晓所有微小粒子，一切存在的位置，方向（you know what I mean, 因为这是非常非常粗糙的说法）， 你就可以感知一切事物的过去，现在和未来。 这个说法似乎是可理解的，但是只要深入去想一点点，就会发现它的实践操作性是几乎完全模糊和不可感知的。比如有些东西无法精确测量， 因为海森堡测不准原理，比如有些东西的变化完全随机，会因为或者不因为任何其他外界干扰而变化（在量子领域）。 还有一个原因是，我已经看了，摄入了足够多的那种“广义而友好”的介绍，我已经不再满足于这种广义而友好的介绍，而是要真正努力地向着那些思考这些人的本源面貌摸索过去。 </p>
<p>当我在观看比如2022年物理奖得主在Nobel minds上的阐述和介绍时，我是基本可以听明白他们的意思的， 但是我相信我能够听明白他们的意思和这些东西原本真实面貌之间的联系一定是模糊的（对此我不能确定，因为费曼也说过如果你不能把你所想的理论非常简单的解释出来，让一个完全不明白的人理解，那么他认为你就不明白这个东西，不过对于费曼是否说过这句话我没有认真考证过，但是按照我自己的感受，我想这种思路不太可能，因为我自己也完全没有能力简单地让一个别人明白我如何摄入和建立一个系统，而且我不认为这是因为我本身不理解的原因），对于这种友好而广义的介绍我已经听的够多了，所以来试着摄入一点真实的东西。</p>
<p>我在MIT OCW上输入了atom， 然后就看到最上面的AMO，by wolfgang kettele.（这个时候我对AMO是什么以及Wolfgang kettele是谁，做了什么都完全不了解） 于是我就开始学习这个， 第一节的标题是resonance， 我到现在连第一节课都没有看完，不过我想某种意义上（其实我很讨厌说某种意义，当你说某种意义的时候，这个某种意义一定是你所想到的一个具体的含义，但是你因为觉得懒散或者不重要而略过它，不过我很讨厌，我应当尽量避免这种含糊的东西，并且就算遇到也尽可能把这个某种意义详细展开阐述，在此的某种意义的含义大概是，因为这是一个巨大全新的系统，而且有可能它的混沌程度不低于我所建立过的混沌系统，比如语言系统的更低，所以我此时相当于只是在进行一种自然和无压的无意识摄入，不过其实也并非完全无意识，所以看完和没有看完在对于我是否理解了更多层面上可能不存在太大差别， 即使你只看了第一课，这一节课的延伸展开也足矣带给你非常高密度熵量的信息和逻辑或者思路了）注意到教授的英语口音一听就是德国人， 然后我注意他有提到，他对于MIT OCW的接触也是最近的事情， 于是我查看了一下这个课程的录制时间，看到好像是2014年， 说明MIT OCW的建设历史并非是非常久远。 另外比较让我注意的是，Mr. Wolfgang 有提到这一套AMO的课程和其他，或者此前他所了解的OCW所给出的课程有比较明显的区别，正如我先前所提及，对于非常深入，或者相对一个对此系统完全不认识的全新大脑来说， 摄入和建立一整套系统是相当困难的，如果早先就和他们（我总是不自然地想使用我自己发明的类似于混沌系统&#x2F;精神体来描述，我感觉这是一种思维的本能和对于表达内容更加精确的追求）直接介绍最本源的面貌，可能对他们的摄入有相当的危害，因为一无所知会使人体产生不适，这种不适当然会造成摄入（这个摄入当然就是学习的意思，我想要使用更为本源和精准的含义来描述，而且我想所给予的信息理解难度和摄入的效率这两个抽象的值很大程度上可以使用函数粗糙地拟合）的低效和抵触性，所以你必须起先给予他们能够简单理解的含义，并且这种简单理解的含义尽可能不要违背这个复杂系统本源的含义（不过我想这两个目的之间当然又有可能存在着难以调和的冲突）。我本身也可以明确感受到，此前我所想学习过的OCW上的其他课程的确更加“友好和广义”，我印象中有的是， Pro f. Nancy Kanwisher的Brain Science，Prof. Julian Beinart的 Theory of City Form, Mihir Kedia和Aseem Kishore A Gentle Introduction To Programming Using Python，对于我自己的对于友好和广义的定义就是这是我能够比较愉快地理解和摄入的的信息， 或者更简单来说，它直接在标题给出了这是gentle的。 而我所找到的Prof. Wolfgang 的这个课程是本源的，并非“友好而广义”的，于是听到这句话我很高兴，因为这就是我想感受的东西。于是当我开始摄入的时候，我也的确明显地感觉到这种并非“友好和广义”的含义，相对于，比如说以上我所举出的其他例子来说，这个lecture我可以明白的内容少非常多，并且存在非常多我完全不了解，没有学习和训练使用过的工具，比如说Fourier transforma，当我听到Fourier transform的时候，我在想，那我还要学习一下Fourier transform才行，于是我又去搜索相关的材料，然后开始和Stanford的prof. Brad Osgood学习fourier transform, 我不记得是学到第一课还是第二课结尾，Brad给出了Fourier transform一个非常广义，涵盖性的公式，而那个公式的右侧是一个我没有学过和没有理解过的欧拉公式，于是我想，我需要学习欧拉公式，于是我先是直接学习了一个khan academy给出的对欧拉公式的简单介绍（我看到这个视频只有短短10分钟左右就认定这个视频是很残缺的，不过我当然还是认真看完了，并且学习到一点简单的推导），然后我去MIT OCW寻找能够让我明白欧拉公式的教学，我找到的是Prof Gilbert Strang的calculus系列lecture，于是我开始学习这个lecture， 这个lecture系列几乎是我在MIT上学的最短和最能学进去的数学类的lecture了，我到目前为止学习了product rule, quotient, rule, chain rule, L hopital rule, limit, inverse function这些我以前一直想明白的但很长时间都没明白的东西（因为我没认真学或者没有找到好的学习材料或者我相关的理解能力很弱）， 并且我终于知道了一些我不明白的符号的含义，并且我终于明白了如何求曲线下的面积，比如y&#x3D;x*2，0到1函数和x轴之间面积的求法，我在网上找了很大相关的如何求曲线面积的视频教学，但是大部分的他们都略过了中间具体的计算方法，我最终在chatgpt那里问了好多次才把中间的演算过程问出来。</p>
<p>一般来说的演算过程是</p>
<p>首先，我们需要明确我们要计算的是函数f(x) &#x3D; x²在区间[0, 1]上的面积。</p>
<p>使用定积分的方法来计算该面积。</p>
<p>∫[0, 1] x² dx</p>
<p>&#x3D; [x³&#x2F;3]从0到1</p>
<p>&#x3D; (1³&#x2F;3) - (0³&#x2F;3)</p>
<p>&#x3D; 1&#x2F;3 - 0</p>
<p>&#x3D; 1&#x2F;3</p>
<p>所以，函数f(x) &#x3D; x²在区间[0, 1]上的面积为1&#x2F;3</p>
<p>这个定积分是怎么算的我目前还没弄明白</p>
<p>但是我想要的，并且通过不断调整设问问chatgpt问出来的是这个</p>
<p>首先，我们将区间[0, 1]分成无穷小的小矩形，每个小矩形的宽度为Δx。然后，计算每个小矩形的面积，即x²乘以Δx。最后，将所有小矩形的面积相加，即求和Σ(x² * Δx)。</p>
<p>现在，我们来详细展开计算过程：</p>
<ol>
<li><p>将区间[0, 1]分成n个小矩形，每个小矩形的宽度为Δx &#x3D; (1 - 0) &#x2F; n &#x3D; 1&#x2F;n。</p>
</li>
<li><p>计算每个小矩形的面积，即x²乘以Δx。对于第i个小矩形，其左边界为xᵢ &#x3D; 0 + (i-1)Δx &#x3D; (i-1)&#x2F;n，右边界为xᵢ₊₁ &#x3D; 0 + iΔx &#x3D; i&#x2F;n。小矩形的面积为f(xᵢ)Δx &#x3D; (xᵢ)²Δx &#x3D; ((i-1)&#x2F;n)²(1&#x2F;n) &#x3D; (i-1)²&#x2F;n³。</p>
</li>
<li><p>将所有小矩形的面积相加，即求和Σ((i-1)²&#x2F;n³)。使用求和符号表示为∑((i-1)²&#x2F;n³)，其中i从1到n。</p>
</li>
<li><p>展开求和符号：</p>
<p>∑((i-1)²&#x2F;n³) &#x3D; (0²&#x2F;n³) + (1²&#x2F;n³) + (2²&#x2F;n³) + … + ((n-1)²&#x2F;n³)<br>        &#x3D; (0 + 1 + 4 + … + (n-1)²) &#x2F; n³</p>
</li>
<li><p>计算求和：</p>
<p>(0 + 1 + 4 + … + (n-1)²) &#x3D; n(n-1)(2n-1)&#x2F;6</p>
<p>代入求和结果：</p>
<p>∑((i-1)²&#x2F;n³) &#x3D; (n(n-1)(2n-1)&#x2F;6) &#x2F; n³</p>
</li>
<li><p>化简：</p>
<p>∑((i-1)²&#x2F;n³) &#x3D; (n-1)(2n-1)&#x2F;6n²</p>
</li>
<li><p>当n趋向于无穷大时，即n→∞，我们可以将Σ((i-1)²&#x2F;n³)近似为定积分∫[0, 1] x² dx。</p>
</li>
<li><p>将求和结果代入：</p>
<p>∫[0, 1] x² dx &#x3D; (n-1)(2n-1)&#x2F;6n²</p>
</li>
<li><p>当n趋向于无穷大时，即n→∞，我们可以求出定积分的结果。</p>
<p>lim(n→∞) [(n-1)(2n-1)&#x2F;6n²] &#x3D; 1&#x2F;3</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>所以，函数f(x) &#x3D; x²在区间[0, 1]上的面积为1&#x2F;3</p>
<p>这个是我目前的能力能够理解的，并且它里面的第七部还使用了我之前学习的洛必达法则，所以当我发现我可以将之前学到的技能（我认为叫做“工具”更准确和熟练）付诸使用是一件微妙的事情。</p>
<p>所以从以上这些过程中可以看出很多的东西，第一不那么“广义和友好”的lecture需要一个非常庞大的已有的工具系统，这些工具系统的建立和熟练使用需要时间和脑力， 它的混沌程度粗糙的说和语言系统近似，在建立的时间尺度上可能和语言系统类似，可能一般以年为单位。我记得我完整地观看了（其实就是昨天刚刚看的）Wolfgang的采访，大约一个多小时，Wolfgang有提到在他32岁的时候，或者我记得他说的是，那个时候他已经32岁了，他不可能去从事全新的东西，他还是需要使用他原有的工具继续进行下去，所以我想对于他来说，也有很多工具是他所不熟练或者不会使用的。而我现在的局限性显然要强的更多了，不过我唯一的优势只是我还有能力选择学习和使用哪些工具。并且我我也在这个过程中个人可以做到的东西非常微小，后来我又认真的听了wolfgang在一个大学的对于他说研究的东西的简单介绍，大约一个多小时，如果不算结尾的提问时间大约是一个小时，于是迄今为止我也终于对AMO有了一个较为粗糙和系统的认识。</p>
<p>首先我可以感觉到Wolfgang所从事，接触思考的内容确实是与AMO，也就是atom，molecule，optic高度相关的，要想明白Wolfgang所从事的研究，最直接，深入和能够让人体会理解的切入性介绍就是低温，他要把一些物质降低到非常非常低的温度，然后通过介绍如何把物质降低到非常非常低的温度以及为什么要这样做，会有什么效果的过程中，他可以依次将所涉及的信息点有层次的剥离和介绍出来，于是他首先要告诉我们，什么是温度，以及要求我们终身都记住一个“有趣的事实”，空气分子正在以飞机的速度撞击你的皮肤，然后告诉我们如何降低温度，一种的激光的方法，这一种方法在上个世界大约90年代才逐渐开始普及或者流行起来，另一种和空调的方法一样。</p>
<p>采用激光，也就是光子，photon去撞击原子，然后通过多普勒效应将原子的能量逐渐带走（但是我还是不太明白多普勒效应是怎么把原子的能量带走的），当原子的能量逐渐减少，也就是它们的温度降低了，因为温度就是微观下分子的运动速度。然后Wolfgang告诉我们他将激光降温和压缩（原谅我不太记得那个术语的名称了）这两种结合在一起，并且这个结合花了他不少时间精力，因为激光降温的粒子群的温度上限和后者所要求的最低下限相差的很远，所以将两者较大的差距bridge在一起是一个以前没人做到过的东西。但是他做到了，具体怎样做到我好像不太记得，或者他没有具体解释？然后当温度降低到一个非常低的程度，低于宇宙中任何一处地方的温度的时候，当达到那个要求的时候，这些粒子就会出现波色爱因斯坦态，然后wolf刚从四个角度介绍了这一小团波色爱因斯坦态粒子的性质，我还有印象的性质是，这一小团原子，大约有百万级别的数量级的，所有的原子都以相同的方式运动，而一般的原子以无序的方式运动，并且它们有着特定的自旋方式，可以通过两束激光检测出来，并且它们存在特殊的衍射模式，因为它们同时具有波和粒子的性质。</p>
<p>我要休息一下，我写不动了。</p>

<p><strong>Foreword</strong></p>
<p>*<em>^Lolita, or the Confession of a White Widowed Male,<strong><strong>n</strong> <strong>such were the two titles under wbicb the writer of the present note received the strange pages it preambulates. ^Humbert Humbert,</strong> <strong>”</strong> <strong>their author had died in legal captivity, of coronary thrombosis, on November i6</strong></strong>y</em>* <strong>1952, a fiw days before his trial was scheduled to start. His laivyer, my goodfriend and relation, Clarence Choate Clark, Esq., now of he Districf of Columbia bar, in asking me to edit the manuscript****t</strong> *<em>based his request on a clause in his client’s will which empowered wiy eminent cousin to use his discretion in all matters pertaining to the preparation cf^Lolittf for print. Mr. Claris decision may have been influenced by the fact that the editor ofhis choice hadjust been awarded the Poling Prize for a modest work (<strong><strong>tt</strong></strong>Do the Senses make Sensed) therein certain morbid states and perversions had been discussed.</em>*</p>
<p><strong>My task proved simpler than either of us had anticipated. Save for the correction cf obvious solecisms and a careful suppression of a fiw tenacious details that despite “H.H.</strong> <strong>m<strong><strong>s oivn efforts still subsisted in his text as signposts and tombstones (indicative cfplaces or persons that taste i^ould conceal and compassion spare), Ms remarkable memoir ispresented intact.

<p><strong>Viewed simply as a novel, ^Lolita’ deals with situations and emotions that would remain exasperatingly vague to the reader had their expression been etiolated by means of platitudinous evasions. True, not a single obscene term is to befound in the whole work; indeed^ the robust philistine who is conditioned by modern conventions into accepting without qualms a lavish array of four-letter uards in a banal novel, will be quite shocked by their absence here, Ifi however, for this paradoxical prude’s comforty an editor attempted to dilute or omit scenes that a certain type of mind might call</strong> <strong>u<strong><strong>aphrodisiac</strong></strong>n</strong> <strong>(see in this respect the monumental decision rendered December</strong> 6,<strong>1933, by Hon.

<p>Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.</p>
<p>She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.</p>
<p>Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</p>
<p>Ladies and gendemen of the ju功 exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.</p>
<p><em><strong>*2*</strong></em></p>
<p>I was born in 1910, in Paris. My father was a gende, easy-going person, a salad of racial genes: a Swiss citizen, of mixed French and Austrian descent, with a dash of the Danube in his veins. I am going to pass around in a minute some lovely; glossyblue picture-postcards. He owned a luxurious hotel on the Riviera. His father and two grandfathers had sold wine, jewels and silk, respectively; At thirty he married an English girl, daughter of Jerome Dunn, the alpinist, and granddaughter of two Dorset parsons, experts in obscure subjects—paleopedology and Aeolian harps, respectively; My very photogenic mother died in a freak accident (picnic, lightning) when I was three, and, save for a pocket of warmth in the darkest past, nothing of her subsists within the hollows and dells of memo% over which, if you can still stand my style (I am writing under observation), the sun of my infancy had set: surely you all know those redolent remnants of day suspended, with the midges, about some hedge in bloom or suddenly entered and traversed by the rambler, at the bottom of a hill, in the summer dusl^ a furry warmth, golden midges.</p>
<p>My mothers elder sister; Sybil, whom a cousin of my fathers had married and then neglected, served in my immediate family as a kind of unpaid governess and housekeeper. Somebody told me later that she had been in love with my father, and that he had lightheartedly taken advantage of it one rainy day and forgotten it by the time the weather cleared. I was extremely fond of her, despite the rigidity——the fatal rigidity—of some of her rules. Perhaps she wanted to make of me, in the fullness of time, a better widower than my father. Aunt Sybil had pink-rimmed azure eyes and a waxen complexion. She wrote poetry. She was poetically superstitious. She said she knew she would die soon after my sixteenth birthday and did. Her husband, a great traveler in perfumes, spent most of his time in America, where eventually he founded a firm and acquired a bit of real estate.</p>
<p>I grew, a happ% healthy child in a bright would of illustrated books, clean sand, orange trees, friendly dogs, sea vistas and smiling faces. Around me the splendid Hotel Mirana revolved as a kind of private universe, a whitewashed cosmos within the blue greater one that blazed outside. From the aproned pot-scrubber to the flanneled potentate, everybody liked me, everybody petted me. Elderly American ladies leaning on their canes listed towards me like towers of Pisa. Ruined Russian princesses who could not pay my father, bought me expensive bonbons. He, <strong>mon cher petit papa,</strong> took me out boating and biking, taught me to swim and dive and water-ski, read to me <strong>Don Quixote</strong> and <strong>Les Miserable^</strong> and I adored and respected him and felt glad for him whenever I overheard the servants discuss his various lady-friends, beautiful and kind beings who made much of me and cooed and shed precious tears over my cheerful motherlessness.</p>
<p>I attended an English day school a few miles from home, and there I played rackets and fives, and got excellent marks, and was on perfect terms with schoolmates and teachers alike. The only definite sexual events that I can remember as having occurred before my thirteenth birthday (that is, before I first saw my little Annabel) were: a solemn, decorous and purely theoretical talk about pubertal surprises in the rose garden of the school with an American kid, the son of a then celebrated motion-picture actress whom he seldom saw in the three-dimensional world; and some interesting reactions on the part of my organism to certain photographs, pearl and umbra, with infinitely soft partings, in Pichons sumptuous <strong>Le Beaute Humaine</strong> that that I had filched from under a mountain of marble-bound <strong>Graphics</strong> in the hotel library; Later, in his delightful debonair manner, my father gave me all the information he thought I needed about sex; this was just before sending me, in the autumn of 1923, to a <strong>lycee</strong></p>
<p>in Lyon (where we were to spend three winters); but alas, in the summer of that year; he was touring Italy with Mme de R. and her daughter, and I had nobody to complain to, nobody to consult.</p>
<p><em><strong>*3*</strong></em></p>
<p>Annabel was, like the writer, of mixed parentage: half-English, half-Dutch, in her case. I remember her features far less distinctly today than I did a few years ago, before I knew Lolita. There are two kinds of visual memory: one when you skillfully recreate an image in the laboratory of your mind, with your eyes open (and then I see Annabel in such general terms as: ahoney-colored skin,” “think arms,” “brown bobbed hair,” “long lashes,” “big bright mouth”)； and the other when you instantly evoke, with shut eyes, on the dark inner side of your eyelids, the objective, absolutely optical replica of a beloved face, a little ghost in natural colors (and this is how I see Lolita).</p>
<p>Let me therefore primly limit myself in describing Annabel, to saying she was a lovely child a few months my junior. Her parents were old friends of my aunt’s, and as stuffy as she. They had rented a villa not far from Hotel Mirana. Bald brown Mr. Leigh and fat, powdered Mrs. Leigh (born Vanessa van Ness). How I loathed them! At first, Annabel and I talked of peripheral affairs. She kept lifting handfuls of fine sand and letting it pour through her fingers. Our brains were turned the way those of intelligent European pre adolescents were in our day and set, and I doubt if much individual genius should be assigned to our interest in the plurality of inhabited worlds, competitive tennis, infinity solipsism and so on. The softness and fragility of baby animals caused us the same intense pain. She wanted to be a nurse in some famished Asiatic country; I wanted to be a famous spy</p>
<p>All at once we were madl% clumsily shamelessly agonizingly in love with each other; hopelessly I should add, because that frenzy of mutual possession might have been assuaged only by our actually imbibing and assimilating every particle of each others soul and flesh; but there we were, unable even to mate as slum children would have so easily found an opportunity to do. After one wild attempt we made to meet at night in her garden (of which more later), the only privacy we were allowed was to be out of earshot but not out of sight on the populous part of the <strong>plage.</strong> There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other: her hand, halShidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer; then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey; sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other’s salty lips; these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed at each other, could bring relief</p>
<p>Among some treasures I lost during the wanderings of my adult years, there was a snapshot taken by my aunt which showed Annabel, her parents and the staid, elderly; lame gentleman, a Dr. Cooper, who that same summer courted my aunt, grouped around a table in a sidewalk cafe. Annabel did not come out well, caught as she was in the act of bending over her <strong>chocolat glace,</strong> and her thin bare shoulders and the parting in her hair were about all that could be identified (as I remember that picture) amid the sunny blur into which her lost loveliness graded; but I, sitting somewhat apart from the rest, came out with a kind of dramatic conspicuousness: a mood% beetle- browed boy in a dark sport shirt and well-tailored white shorts, his legs crossed, sitting in profile, looking away; That photograph was taken on the last day of our fatal summer and just a few minutes before we made our second and final attempt to thwart fate. Under the flimsiest of pretexts (this was our very last chance, and nothing really mattered) we escaped from the cafe to the beach, and found a desolate stretch of sand, and there, in the violet shadow of some red rocks forming a kind of cave, had a brief session of avid caresses, with somebody s lost pair of sunglasses for only witness. I was on my knees, and on the point of possessing my darling, when two bearded bathers, the old man of the sea and his brother, came out of the sea with exclamations of ribald encouragement, and four months later she died of typhus in Corfu.</p>
<p><em><strong>*4*</strong></em></p>
<p>I leaf again and again through these miserable memories, and keep asking myself was it then, in the glitter of that remote summer, that the rift in my life began; or was my excessive desire for that child only the first evidence of an inherent singularity? When I try to analyze my own cravings, motives, actions and so forth, I surrender to a sort of retrospective imagination which feeds the analytic faculty with boundless alternatives and which causes each visualized route to fork and re-fork without end in the maddeningly complex prospect of my past. I am convinced, however, that in a certain magic and fateful way Lolita began with Annabel.</p>
<p>I also know that the shock of Annabels death consolidated the frustration of that nightmare summer, made of it a permanent obstacle to any further romance throughout the cold years of my youth. The spiritual and the physical had been blended in us with a perfection that must remain incomprehensible to the matter-of-fact, crude, standard-brained youngsters of today; Long after her death I felt her thoughts floating through mine. Long before we met we had had the same dreams. We compared notes. We found strange affinities. The same June of the same year (1919) a stray canary had fluttered into her house and mine, in two widely separated countries. Oh, Lolita, had you loved me thus!</p>
<p>I have reserved for the conclusion of my “Annabel” phase the account of our unsuccessful first tryst. One night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family; In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the ruins of a low stone wall. Through the darkness and the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory; appear to me now like playing cards一presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant s均 seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky; strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, half-pleasure, half-pain, came over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to kiss me, her head would bend with a sleep% soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again; and her quivering mouth, distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my face. She would try to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine; then my darling would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on her open mouth, while with a generosity that was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion.</p>
<p>I recall the scent of some kind of toilet powder—I believe she stole it from her mother’s Spanish maid——a sweetish, lowly; musky perfume. It mingled with her own biscuity odor, and my senses were suddenly filled to the brim; a sudden commotion in a nearby bush prevented them from overflowing—and as we drew away from each other, and with aching veins attended to what was probably a prowling cat, there came from the house her mother’s voice calling her, with a rising frantic note—and Dr. Cooper ponderously limped out into the garden. But that mimosa grove—the haze of stars, the tingle, the flame, the honey-dew; and the ache remained with me, and that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted me ever since—until at last, twenty-four years later, I broke her spell by incarnating her in another.</p>
<p><em><strong>*5*</strong></em></p>
<p>The days of my youth, as I look back on them, seem to fly away from me in a flurry of pale repetitive scraps like those morning snow storms of used tissue paper that a train passenger sees whirling in the wake of the observation car. In my sanitary relations with women I was practical, ironical and brisk. While a college student, in London and Paris, paid ladies sufficed me. My studies were meticulous and intense, although not particularly fruitful. At first, I planned to take a degree in psychiatry and many <strong>manque</strong> talents do; but I was even more <strong>manque</strong> than that; a peculiar exhaustion, I am so oppressed, doctor, set in; and I switched to English literature, where so many frustrated poets end as pipe-smoking teachers in tweeds. Paris suited me. I discussed Soviet movies with expatriates. I sat with uranists in the <strong>Deux Magpts.</strong> I published tortuous essays in obscure journals. I composed pastiches:</p>
<p>…Fraulein von Kulp</p>
<p>may turn, her hand upon the door;</p>
<p>I will not follow her. Nor Fresca. Nor</p>
<p>that Gull.</p>
<p>A paper of mine entitled “The Proustian theme in a letter from Keats to Benjamin Bailey” was chuckled over by the six or seven scholars who read it. I launched upon an <strong>a<strong><strong>Histoire abregee de la poesie anglaise</strong></strong>n</strong> for a prominent publishing firm, and then started to compile that manual of French literature for English-speaking students (with comparisons drawn from English writers) which was to occupy me throughout the forties一and the last volume of which was almost ready for press by the time of my arrest.</p>
<p>I found a job一teaching English to a group of adults in Auteuil. Then a school for boys employed me for a couple of winters. Now and then I took advantage of the acquaintances I had formed among social workers and psychotherapists to visit in their company various institutions, such as orphanages and reform schools, where pale pubescent girls with matted eyelashes could be stared at in perfect impunity remindful of that granted one in dreams.</p>
<p>Now I wish to introduce the following idea. Between the age limits of nine and fourteen there occur maidens who, to certain bewitched travelers, twice or many times older than the&#x2F; reveal their true nature which is not human, but nymphic (that is, demoniac); and these chosen creatures I propose to designate as “nymphets.”</p>
<p>It will be marked that I substitute time terms for spatial ones. In fact, I would have the reader see “nine” and Ufourteenw as the boundaries—the mirrory beaches and rosy rocks—of an enchanted island haunted by those nymphets of mine and surrounded by a vast, misty sea. Between those age limits, are all girl-children nymphets? Of course not. Otherwise, we who are in the know we lone voyagers, we nympholepts, would have long gone insane. Neither are good looks any criterion; and vulgarity or at least what a given community terms so, does not necessarily impair certain mysterious characteristics, the fey grace, the elusive, shifty soul-shattering, insidious charm that separates the nymphet from such coevals of hers as are incomparably more dependent on the spatial world of synchronous phenomena than on that intangible island of entranced time where Lolita plays with her likes. Within the same age limits the number of true nymphets is trickingly inferior to that of provisionally plain, or just nice, or “cute,”or even “sweet”and “attractive,wordinary plumpish, formless, cold-skinned, essentially human litde girls, with tummies and pigtails, who may or may not turn into adults of great beauty (look at the ugly dumplings in black stockings and white hats that are metamorphosed into stunning stars of the screen). A normal man given</p>
<p>a group photograph of school girls or Girl Scouts and asked to point out the comeli- est one will not necessarily choose the nymphet among them. You have to be an artist and a madman, a creature of infinite melancholy with a bubble of hot poison in your loins and a super-voluptuous flame permanendy aglow in your subtle spine (oh, how you have to cringe and hide!), in order to discern at once, by ineffable signs一the slightly feline outline of a cheekbone, the slenderness of a downy limb, and other indices which despair and shame and tears of tenderness forbid me to tabulate一the little deadly demon among the wholesome children; <strong>she</strong> stands unrecognized by them and unconscious herself of her fantastic power.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the idea of time plays such a magic part in the matter, the student should not be surprised to learn that there must be a gap of several years, never less than ten I should sa» generally thirty or fbrtj^ and as many as ninety in a few known cases, between maiden and man to enable the latter to come under a nymphets spell. It is a question of focal adjustment, of a certain distance that the inner eye thrills to surmount, and a certain contrast that the mind perceives with a gasp of perverse delight. When I was a child and she was a child, my little Annabel was no nymphet to me; I was her equal, a faunlet in my own right, on that same enchanted island of time; but today, in September 1952, after twenty-nine years have elapsed, I think I can distinguish in her the initial fateful elf in my life. We loved each other with a premature love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives. I was a strong lad and survived; but the poison was in the wound, and the wound remained ever open, and soon I found myself maturing amid a civilization which allows a man of twenty- five to court a girl of sixteen but not a girl of twelve.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that my adult life during the European period of my existence proved monstrously twofold. Overtly, I had so-called normal relationships with a number of terrestrial women having pumpkins or pears for breasts; inly I was consumed by a hell furnace of localized lust for every passing nymphet whom as a law-abiding poltroon I never dared approach. The human females I was allowed to wield were but palliative agents. I am ready to believe that the sensations I derived from natural fornication were much the same as those known to normal big males consorting with their normal big mates in that routine rhythm which shakes the world. The trouble was that those gentlemen had not, and I <strong>had,</strong> caught glimpses of an incomparably more poignant bliss. The dimmest of my pollutive dreams was a thousand times more dazzling than all the adultery the most virile writer of genius or the most talented impotent might imagine. My world was split. I was aware of not one but two sexes, neither of which was mine; both would be termed female by the anatomist. But to me, through the prism of my senses, uthey were as different as mist and mast.” All this I rationalize now In my twenties and early thirties, I did not understand my throes quite so clearly; While my body knew what it craved for, my mind rejected my bodys every plea. One moment I was ashamed and frightened, another recklessly optimistic. Taboos strangulated me. Psychoanalysts wooed me with pseudoliberations of pseudoli- bidoes.The fact that to me the only object of amorous tremor were sisters of Annabels, her handmaids and girl-pages, appeared to me at times as a forerunner of insanity. At other times I would tell myself that it was all a question of attitude, that there was really nothing wrong in being moved to distraction by girl-children. Let me remind my reader that in England, with the passage of the Children and Young Person Act in 1933, the term “girl-child” is defined as “a girl who is over eight but under fourteen years” (after that, from fourteen to seventeen, the statutory definition is “young per- sorf,). In Massachusetts, U.S., on the other hand, a “wayward child”is, technically one “between seven and seventeen years of age” (who, moreover, habitually associates with vicious or immoral persons). Hugh Broughton, a writer of controversy in the reign of James the Rrst, has proved that Rahab was a harlot at ten years of age. This is all very interesting, and I daresay you see me already frothing at the mouth in a fit; but no, I am not; I am just winking happy thoughts into a little tiddle cup. Here are some more pictures. Here is Virgil who could the nymphet sing in a single tone, but probably preferred a lads perineum. Here are two of King Akhnatens and Queen Nefer- titi’s pre-nubile Nile daughters (that royal couple had a litter of six), wearing nothing but many necklaces of bright beads, relaxed on cushions, intact after three thousand years, with their soft brown puppybodies, cropped hair and long ebony eyes. Here are some brides of ten compelled to seat themselves on the fascinum, the virile ivory in the temples of classical scholarship. Marriage and cohabitation before the age of puberty are still not uncommon in certain East Indian provinces. Lepcha old men of eighty copulate with girls of eight, and nobody minds. After all, Dante fell madly in love with Beatrice when she was nine, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely; and bejeweled, in a crimson frock, and this was in 1274, in Florence, at a private feast in the merry month of May; And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of twelve running in the wind, in the pollen and dust, a flower in flight, in the beautiful plain as descried from the hills of Vaucluse.</p>
<p>But let us be prim and civilized. Humbert Humbert tried hard to be good. Really and trul% he id. He had the utmost respect for ordinary children, with their purity and vulnerability and under no circumstances would he have interfered with the innocence of a child, if there was the least risk of a <strong>row.</strong> But how his heart beat when, among the innocent throng, he espied a demon child,<strong>u****enfant charmante etfourbe^</strong> dim eyes, bright lips, ten years in jail if you only show her you are looking at her. So life went. Humbert was perfectly capable of intercourse with Eve, but it was Lilith he longed for. The bud-stage of breast development appears early (10.7 years) in the sequence of somatic changes accompanying pubescence. And the next maturational item available is the first appearance of pigmented pubic hair (11.2 years). My little cup brims with tiddies.</p>
<p>A shipwreck. An atoll. Alone with a drowned passengers shivering child. Darling, this is only a game! How marvelous were my fancied adventures as I sat on a hard park bench pretending to be immersed in a trembling book. Around the quiet scholar, nymphets played freely as if he were a familiar statue or part of an old trees shadow and sheen. Once a perfect little beauty in a tartan frock, with a clatter put her heavily armed foot near me upon the bench to dip her slim bare arms into me and tighten the strap of her roller skate, and I dissolved in the sun, with my book for fig leaf^ as her auburn ringlets fell all over her skinned knee, and the shadow of leaves I shared pulsated and melted on her radiant limb next to my chameloenic cheek. Another time a red-haired school girl hung over me in the metro, and a revelation of axillary russet I obtained remained in my blood for weeks. I could list a great number of these onesided diminutive romances. Some of them ended in a rich flavor of hell. It happened for instance that from my balcony I would notice a lighted window across the street and what looked like a nymphet in the act of undressing before a co-operative mirror. Thus isolated, thus removed, the vision acquired an especially keen charm that made me race with all speed toward my lone gratification. But abruptly fiendishly the tender pattern of nudity I had adored would be transformed into the disgusting lamp- lit bare arm of a man in his underclothes reading his paper by the open window in the hot, damp, hopeless summer night.</p>
<p>Rope-skipping, hopscotch. That old woman in black who sat down next to me on my bench, on my rack of joy (a nymphet was groping under me for a lost marble), and asked if I had stomachache, the insolent hag. Ah, leave me alone in my pubescent park, in my mossy garden. Let them play around me forever. Never grow up.</p>
<p><em><strong>*6*</strong></em></p>
<p>A propos: I have often wondered what became of those nymphets later? In this wrought-iron would of criss-cross cause and effect, could it be that the hidden throb I stole from them did not affect their future? I had possessed her—and she never knew it. All right. But would it not tell sometime later? Had I not somehow tampered with her fate by involving her image in my voluptas? Oh, it was, and remains, a source of great and terrible wonder.</p>
<p>I learned, however, what they looked like, those lovely^ maddening, thin-armed nymphets, when they grew up. I remember walking along an animated street on a gray spring afternoon somewhere near the Madeleine. A short slim girl passed me at a rapid, high-heeled, tripping step, we glanced back at the same moment, she stopped and I accosted her. She came hardly up to my chest hair and had the kind of dimpled round litde face French girls so often have, and I liked her long lashes and tight-fitting tailored dress sheathing in pearl-gray her young body which still retained—and that was the nymphic echo, the chill of delight, the leap in my loins—a childish something mingling with the professional <strong>fretillement</strong> of her small agile rump. I asked her price, and she promptly replied with melodious silvery precision (a bird, a very bird!) <strong>u<strong><strong>CenL</strong></strong>n</strong> I tried to haggle but she saw the awful lone longing in my lowered eyes, directed so far down at her round forehead and rudimentary hat (a band, a posy); and with one beat of her lashes: <strong>u****7antpis^</strong> she said, and made as if to move away; Perhaps only three years earlier I might have seen her coming home from school! That evocation settled the matter. She led me up the usual steep stairs, with the usual bell clearing the way for the <strong>monsieur</strong> who might not care to meet another <strong>monsieur****y</strong> on the mournful climb to the abject room, all bed and <strong>bidet. As</strong> usual, she asked at once for her ?我衫 <strong>cadeau****y</strong> and as usual I asked her name (Monique) and her age (eighteen). I was pretty well acquainted with the banal way of streetwalkers. They all answer <strong>u****dix- huif</strong>—a trim twitter, a note of finality and wistful deceit which they emit up to ten times per da% the poor little creatures. But in Moniques case there could be no doubt she was, if anything, adding one or two years to her age. This I deduced from many details of her compact, neat, curiously immature body. Having shed her clothes with fascinating rapidity, she stood for a moment partly wrapped in the dingy gauze of the window curtain listening with infantile pleasure, as pat as pat could be, to an organ-grinder in the dust-brimming courtyard below; When I examined her small hands and drew her attention to their grubby fingernails, she said with a naive frown “O勿公 <strong>ce rfestpas bien^</strong> and went to the wash-basin, but I said it did not matter, did not matter at all. With her brown bobbed hair, luminous gray eyes and pale skin, she looked perfectly charming. Her hips were no bigger than those of a squatting lad; in fact, I do not hesitate to say (and indeed this is the reason why I linger gratefully in that gauze- gray room of memory with litde Monique) that among the eighty or so <strong>grues</strong> I had had operate upon me, she was the only one that gave me a pang of genuine pleasure. <strong>^Iletait malin, celui qui a invents ce truc-la^</strong> she commented amiably and got back into her clothes with the same high-style speed.</p>
<p>I asked for another, more elaborate, assignment later the same evening, and she said she would meet me at the corner cafe at nine, and swore she had never <strong>pose un lapin</strong> in all her young life. We returned to the same room, and I could not help saying how very pretty she was to which she answered demurely: <strong>“Tues bien gentil de dire</strong> p?” and then, noticing what I noticed too in the mirror reflecting our small Eden——the dreadful grimace of clenched-teeth tenderness that distorted my mouth—dutiful little Monique (oh, she had been a nymphet, all right!) wanted to know if she should remove the layer of red from her lips <strong>avant qiion se couche</strong> in case I planned to kiss her. Of course, I planned it. I let myself go with her more completely than I had with any young lady before, and my last vision that night of long-lashed Monique is touched up with a gaiety that I find seldom associated with any event in my humiliating, sordid, taciturn love life. She looked tremendously pleased with the bonus of fifty I gave her as she trotted out into the April night drizzle with Humbert Humbert lumbering in her narrow wake. Stopping before a window display she said with great gusto: <strong>u****Je vais niacheter des basV</strong> and never may I forget the way her Parisian childish lips exploded on <strong>a****bas^</strong> pronouncing it with an appetite that all but changed the “a” into a brief buoyant bursting “o” as in <strong>“bof.</strong></p>
<p>I had a date with her next day at 2.15 p.m. in my own rooms, but it was less successful, she seemed to have grown less juvenile, more of a woman overnight. A cold I caught from her led me to cancel a fourth assignment, nor was I sorry to break an emotional series that threatened to burden me with heart-rending fantasies and</p>
<p>peter out in dull disappointment. So let her remain, sleek, slender Monique, as she was for a minute or two: a delinquent nymphet shining through the matter-of-fact young whore.</p>
<p>My brief acquaintance with her started a train of thought that may seem pretty obvious to the reader who knows the ropes. An advertisement in a lewd magazine landed me, one brave da% in the office of a Mlle Edith who began by offering me to choose a kindred soul from a collection of rather formal photographs in a rather soiled album <strong>Regardez-moi cette belle brunet).</strong> When I pushed the album away and somehow managed to blurt out my criminal craving, she looked as if about to show me the door; however, after asking me what price I was prepared to disburse, she condescended to put me in touch with a person <strong>quipourrait arranger la chose.</strong> Next da% an asthmatic woman, coarsely painted, garrulous, garlicky; with an almost farcical Provencal accent and a black mustache above a purple lip, took me to what was apparently her own domicile, and there, after explosively kissing the bunched tips of her fat fingers to signify the delectable rosebud quality of her merchandise, she theatrically drew aside a curtain to reveal what I judged was that part of the room where a large and unfas- tidious family usually slept. It was now empty save for a monstrously plump, sallow, repulsively plain girl of at least fifteen with red-ribboned thick black braids who sat on a chair perfunctorily nursing a bald doll. When I shook my head and tried to shuffle out of the trap, the woman, talking fast, began removing the dingy woolen jersey from the young giantess* torso; then, seeing my determination to leave, she demanded <strong>son ardent.</strong> A door at the end of the room was opened, and two men who had been dining in the kitchen joined in the squabble. They were misshapen, bare-necked, very swarthy and one of them wore dark glasses. A small boy and a begrimed, bowlegged toddler lurked behind them. With the insolent logic of a nightmare, the enraged procuress, indicating the man in glasses, said he had served in the police, <strong>lui****y</strong> so that I had better do as I was told. I went up to Marie—for that was her stellar name—who by then had quietly transferred her heavy haunches to a stool at the kitchen table and resumed her interrupted soup while the toddler picked up the doll. With a surge of pity dramatizing my idiotic gesture, I thrust a banknote into her indifferent hand. She surrendered my gift to the ex-detective, whereupon I was suffered to leave.</p>
<p><em><strong>*7*</strong></em></p>
<p>I do not know if the pimps album may not have been another link in the daisy-chain; but soon after, for my own safety I decided to marry. It occurred to me that regular hours, home-cooked meals, all the conventions of marriage, the prophylactic routine of its bedroom activities and, who knows, the eventual flowering of certain moral values, of certain spiritual substitutes, might help me, if not to purge myself of my degrading and dangerous desires, at least to keep them under pacific control. A little money that had come my way after my fathers death (nothing very grand—the Mi- rana had been sold long before), in addition to my striking if somewhat brutal good looks, allowed me to enter upon my quest with equanimity. After considerable deliberation, my choice fell on the daughter of a Polish doctor: the good man happened to be treating me for spells of dizziness and tachycardia. We played chess; his daughter watched me from behind her easel, and inserted eyes or knuckles borrowed from me into the cubistic trash that accomplished misses then painted instead of lilacs and lambs. Let me repeat with quiet force: I was, and still am, despite <strong>mes malhenrs^</strong> an exceptionally handsome male; slow-moving, tall, with soft dark hair and a gloomy but all the more seductive cast of demeanor. Exceptional virility often reflects in the subject^ displayable features a sullen and congested something that pertains to what he has to conceal. And this was my case. Well did I know alas, that I could obtain at the snap of my fingers any adult female I chose; in fact, it had become quite a habit with me of not being too attentive to women lest they come toppling, bloodripe, into my cold lap. Had I been <strong>^fran^ais moyen</strong> with a taste for flashy ladies, I might have easily found, among the many crazed beauties that lashed my grim rock, creatures far more fascinating than X^leria. My choice, however, was prompted by considerations whose essence was, as I realized too late, a piteous compromise. All of which goes to show how dreadfully stupid poor Humbert always was in matters of sex.</p>
<p><em><strong>*8*</strong></em></p>
<p>Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a glorified <strong>pot-au- fiu,</strong> an animated merkin,what really attracted me to Valeria was the imitation she gave of a little girl. She gave it not because she had divined something about me; it was just her style—and I fell for it. Actually she was at least in her late twenties (I never established her exact age for even her passport lied) and had mislaid her virginity under circumstances that changed with her reminiscent moods. I, on my part, was as naive as only a pervert can be. She looked fluffy and frolicsome, dressed <strong>a la gamine^</strong> showed a generous amount of smooth leg, knew how to stress the white of a bare instep by the black of a velvet slipper, and pouted, and dimpled, and romped, and dirndled, and shook her short curly blond hair in the cutest and tritest fashion imaginable.</p>
<p>After a brief ceremony at the <strong>mairie****9</strong>1 tool her to the new apartment I had rented and, somewhat to her surprise, had her wear; before I touched her, a girls plain nightshirt that I had managed to filch from the linen closet of an orphanage. I derived some fun from that nuptial night and had the idiot in hysterics by sunrise. But reality soon asserted itself The bleached curl revealed its melanic root; the down turned to prickles on a shaved shin; the mobile moist mouth, no matter how I stuffed it with love, disclosed ignominiously its resemblance to the corresponding part in a treasured portrait of her toadlike dead mama; and presently instead of a pale litde gutter girl, Humbert Humbert had on his hands a large, short-legged, big-breasted and practically brainless <strong>baba.</strong></p>
<p>This state of affairs lasted from 1935 to 1939. Her only asset was a muted nature which did help to produce an odd sense of comfort in our small squalid flat: two rooms, a hazy view in one window a brick wall in the other, a tiny kitchen, a shoe-shaped bath tub, within which I felt like Marat but with no white-necked maiden to stab me. We had quite a few cozy evenings together, she deep in her <strong>Paris-Soir****f</strong> I working at a rickety table. We went to movies, bicycle races and boxing matches. I appealed to her stale flesh very seldom, only in cases of great urgency and despair. The grocer opposite had a little daughter whose shadow drove me mad; but with Valerias help I did find after all some legal oudets to my fantastic predicament. As to cooking, we tacitly dismissed <strong>pot-au-feu</strong> and had most of our meals at a crowded place in rue Bonaparte where there were wine stains on the table cloth and a good deal of foreign babble. And next door, an art dealer displayed in his cluttered window a splendid, flamboyant, green, red, golden and inlg blue, ancient American estampe一a locomotive with a gigantic smokestack, great baroque lamps and a tremendous cowcatcher, hauling its mauve coaches through the stormy prairie night and mixing a lot of spark- studded black smoke with the furry thunder clouds.</p>
<p>These burst. In the summer of 1939 <strong>mon oncle d’Amerique</strong> died bequeathing me an annual income of a few thousand dollars on condition I came to live in the States and showed some interest in his business. This prospect was most welcome to me. I felt my life needed a shake-up. There was another thing, too: moth holes had appeared in the plush of matrimonial comfort. During the last weeks I had kept noticing that my fat 切ileria was not her usual self; had acquired a queer restlessness; even showed something like irritation at times, which was quite out of keeping with the stock character she was supposed to impersonate. When I informed her we were shortly to sail for New York, she looked distressed and bewildered. There were some tedious difficulties with her papers. She had a Nansen, or better say Nonsense, passport which for some reason a share in her husbands solid Swiss citizenship could not easily transcend; and I decided it was the necessity of queuing in the <strong>prefecture^</strong> and other formalities, that had made her so listless, despite my patiently describing to her America, the country of rosy children and great trees, where life would be such an improvement on dull dingy Paris.</p>
<p>We were coming out of some office building one morning, with her papers almost in order, when Valeria, as she waddled by my side, began to shake her poodle head vigorously without saying a word. I let her go on for a while and then asked if she thought she had something inside. She answered (I translate from her French which was, I imagine, a translation in its turn of some Slavic platitude): aThere is another man in my liW</p>
<p>Now, these are ugly words for a husband to hear. They dazed me, I confess. To beat her up in the street, there and then, as an honest vulgarian might have done, was not feasible. Years of secret sufferings had taught me superhuman self-control. So I ushered her into a taxi which had been invitingly creeping along the curb for some time, and in this comparative privacy I quietly suggested she comment her wild talk. A mounting fury was suffocating me一not because I had any particular fondness for that figure of fun, <strong>Mme Humbert^</strong> but because matters of legal and illegal conjunction were for me alone to decide, and here she was, Valeria, the comedy wife, brazenly preparing to dispose in her own way of my comfort and fate. I demanded her lover’s name. I repeated my question; but she kept up a burlesque babble, discoursing on her unhappiness with me and announcing plans for an immediate divorce. <strong>u****Mais qui est-ce^</strong> I shouted at last, striking her on the knee with my fist; and she, without even wincing, stared at me as if the answer were too simple for words, then gave a quick shrug and pointed at the thick neck of the taxi driver. He pulled up at a small cafe and introduced himselE I do not remember his ridiculous name but after all those years I still see him quite clearly—a stocky White Russian ex-colonel with a bushy mustache and a crew cut; there were thousands of them plying that fools trade in Paris. We sat down at a table; the Tsarist ordered wine, and X^leria, after applying a wet napkin to her knee, went on talking——<strong>into</strong> me rather than to me; she poured words into this dignified receptacle with a volubility I had never suspected she had in her. And every now and then she would volley a burst of Slavic at her stolid lover. The situation was preposterous and became even more so when the taxi-colonel, stopping Valeria with a possessive smile, began to unfold <strong>his</strong> views and plans. With an atrocious accent to his careful French, he delineated the world of love and work into which he proposed to enter hand in hand with his child-wife Valeria. She by now was preening herself between him and me, rouging her pursed lips, tripling her chin to pick at her blousebosom and so forth, and he spoke of her as if she were absent, and also as if she were a kind of little ward that was in the act of being transferred, for her own good, from one wise guardian to another even wiser one; and although my helpless wrath may have exaggerated and disfigured certain impressions, I can swear that he actually consulted me on such things as her diet, her periods, her wardrobe and the books she had read or should read. “I think,”一he said, “She will like <strong>Jean Christophe?’</strong> Oh, he was quite a scholar, Mr. Taxovich.</p>
<p>I put an end to this gibberish by suggesting Valeria pack up her few belongings immediately upon which the platitudinous colonel gallantly offered to carry them into the car. Reverting to his professional state, he drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked, and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether Humbert Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither. I remember once handling an automatic belonging to a fellow student, in the days (I have not spoken of them, I think, but never mind) when I toyed with the idea of enjoying his litde sister, a most diaphanous nymphet with a black hair bow and then shooting myselE I now wondered if Wlechka (as the colonel called her) was really worth shooting, or strangling, or drowning. She had very vulnerable legs, and I decided I would limit myself to hurting her very horribly as soon as we were alone.</p>
<p>But we never were. Alechka—by now shedding torrents of tears tinged with the mess of her rainbow make-up,—started to fill anyhow a trunk, and two suitcases, and a bursting carton, and visions of putting on my mountain boots and taking a run-</p>
<p>ning kick at her rump were of course impossible to put into execution with the cursed colonel hovering around all the time. I cannot say he behaved insolently or anything like that; on the contrary he displayed, as a small sideshow in the theatricals I had been inveigled in, a discreet old-world civility punctuating his movements with all sorts of mispronounced apologies <strong>(j’ai demande pardonne</strong>—excuse me——<strong>est-ce que fai puis</strong>一may I一and so forth), and turning away tactfully when Valechka took down with a flourish her pink panties from the clothesline above the tub; but he seemed to be all over the place at once, <strong>legredin,</strong> agreeing his frame with the anatomy of the flat, reading in my chair my newspaper, untying a knotted string, rolling a cigarette, counting the teaspoons, visiting the bathroom, helping his moll to wrap up the electric fan her father had given her, and carrying streetward her luggage. I sat with arms folded, one hip on the window sill, dying of hate and boredom. At last both were out of the quivering apartment——the vibration of the door I had slammed after them still rang in my every nerve, a poor substitute for the backhand slap with which I ought to have hit her across the cheekbone according to the rules of the movies. Clumsily playing my part, I stomped to the bathroom to check if they had taken my English toilet water; they had not; but I noticed with a spasm of fierce disgust that the former Counselor of the Tsar, after thoroughly easing his bladder, had not flushed the toilet. That solemn pool of alien urine with a sogg}^ tawny cigarette butt disintegrating in it struck me as a crowning insult, and I wildly looked around for a weapon. Actually I daresay it was nothing but middle-class Russian courtesy (with an oriental tang, perhaps) that had prompted the good colonel (Maximovich! his name suddenly taxies back to me), a very formal person as they all are, to muffle his private need in decorous silence so as not to underscore the small size of his hosts domicile with the rush of a gross cascade on top of his own hushed trickle. But this did not enter my mind at the moment, as groaning with rage I ransacked the kitchen for something better than a broom. Then, canceling my search, I dashed out of the house with the heroic decision of attacking him barefisted; despite my natural vigor, I am no pugilist, while the short but broad-shouldered Maximovich seemed made of pig iron. The void of the street, revealing nothing of my wifes departure except a rhinestone button that she had dropped in the mud after preserving it for three unnecessary years in a broken box, may have spared me a bloody nose. But no matter. I had my litde revenge in due time. A man from Pasadena told me one day that Mrs. Maximovich nee Zbo- rovski had died in childbirth around 1945; the couple had somehow got over to California and had been used there, for an excellent salary; in a year-long experiment conducted by a distinguished American ethnologist. The experiment dealt with human and racial reactions to a diet of bananas and dates in a constant position on all fours. My infonnant, a doctor, swore he had seen with his own eyes obese Valechka and her colonel, by then gray-haired and also quite corpulent, diligently crawling about the well-swept floors of a brightly lit set of rooms (fruit in one, water in another, mats in a third and so on) in the company of several other hired quadrupeds, selected from indigent and helpless groups. I tried to find the results of these tests in the <strong>Review of Anthropology^</strong> but they appear not to have been published yet. These scientific products take of course some time to fluctuate. I hope they will be illustrated with photographs when they do get printed, although it is not very likely that a prison library will harbor such erudite works. The one to which I am restricted these days, despite my lawyer’s favors, is a good example of the inane eclecticism governing the selection of books in prison Ebraries. They have the Bible, of course, and Dickens (an ancient set, N.Y., G.W. Dillingham, Publisher, MDCCCLXXXVII); and the <strong>Childrens Encyclopedia</strong> (with some nice photographs of sunshine-haired Girl Scouts in shorts), and <strong>A Murder Is Announced</strong> by Agatha Christie; but they also have such coruscating trifles as <strong>A vagabond in Italy</strong> by Percy Elphinstone, author of <strong>Venice Revisited,</strong> Boston, 1868, and a comparatively recent (1946) <strong>Who’s Who in the Limelight</strong>—actors, producers, playwrights, and shots of static scenes. In looking through the latter volume, I was treated last night to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets love. I transcribe most of the page:</p>
<p>Pym, Roland. Born in Lundy; Mass., 1922. Received stage training at Elsinore Playhouse, Der切 N.Y. Made debut in Sunburst. Among his many appearances are <strong>Two Blocks from Here, The Girl in Green, Scrambled Husbands, The Strange Mushroom, Touch and Go, John Lovely, I Was Dreaming cfYou.</strong></p>
<p>Quilty; Clare, American dramatist. Bom in Ocean Cit^ N.J., 1911. Educated at Columbia University; Started on a commercial career but turned to playwriting. Author of <strong>The Little Nymph&gt; The Lady Who Loved Lightning</strong> (in collaboration with Vivian Darkbloom), <strong>Dark Age****t</strong> <strong>The strange Mushroom, Fatherly Love^</strong> and others. His many plays for children are notable. <strong>Little Nymph</strong> (1940) traveled 14,000 miles and played 280 performances on the road during the winter before ending in New Yjrk. Hobbies: fast cars, photography pets.</p>
<p>Quine, Dolores. Born in 1882, in Dayton, Ohio. Studied for stage at American Academy; First played in Ottawa in 1900. Made New ^ork debut in 1904 in <strong>Never Talk to Strangers.</strong> Has disappeared since in [a list of some thirty plays follows].</p>
<p>How the look of my dear loves name even affixed to some old hag of an actress, still makes me rock with helpless pain! Perhaps, she might have been an actress too. Born 1935. Appeared (I notice the slip of my pen in the preceding paragraph, but please do not correct it, Clarence) in <strong>The Murdered Playwright.</strong> Quine the Swine. Guilty of killing Quilty; Oh, my Lolita, I have only words to play with!</p>

        <p>在此录入一些我对原子弹的理解，由基础到深入</p>
<p>首先你需要原料（铀矿），然后你需要把铀矿里的铀元素精炼出来</p>
<p>然后你要把这个精炼好的，纯度非常高的铀元素做成一个球的样子，因为这样能够最大限度，最有可能的让它充分的链式反应</p>
<p>然后你需要在这个球的外圈非常均匀的装一些高强度的化学炸药，这样炸药引爆以后可以最大限度的给中心的铀球施加足够致使其产生链式反应的压力和热量（这两个的区别我不太分得清楚，反正就那么回事</p>
<p>然后原子弹就爆炸了，这就是原子弹的爆炸原理。</p>
<p>接下来我们会更加深入的看一些制作原子弹的细节</p>

<p>接下来是更为更为具体的介绍</p>
<p>推荐书籍</p>
<p>The Los Alamos primer</p>
<p>an amazing document this is the lectures that were given to the scientists as they were arriving at Los Alamos for the Manhattan Project in about 1943 with lots of additional notes and information by the guy who gave the lectures it really gives you a good introduction to the physics of nuclear weapons as it was understood in 1943 with some updates in the notes.</p>
<p>the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes(page tuner introduction)</p>
<p>if you want a wonderful page-turner historical account of how nuclear weapons were created in the Manhattan Project the making of the atomic bomb by Richard Rhodes is really a classic it’s it’s I think understandable by everyone and yet it gets the physics more or less right if you want a more technical account of the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>critical assembly by hottes and Henriksen Mead and Westfall(more technical)</p>
<p>is much drier than the making of the atomic bomb but much more detailed on the technical front on the effects of nuclear weapons the US government’s textbook on that subject by Gladstone and Dolan is called the effects of nuclear weapons and it’s still available and in fact it’s been put online in PDF form if you search for it</p>
<p> the physical medical and social effects of the atomic bombs</p>
<p> and if you want a detailed account of the impact of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki there’s a book called the physical medical and social effects of the atomic bombings that really is a nice job on The making of atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Nuclear fission: a lot of energy from a little material</p>
<p>Pic </p>
<p>proton (positive) neutron(no charge)</p>
<p>Subcritical:unsustainble</p>
<p>Critical:sustainable </p>
<p>Supercritical :sustainable and grow exponentially </p>
<p>how to make it supercritical</p>
<p>1:add more atoms, enough material</p>
<p>Pic1</p>
<p>2:reflect the neutrons back in</p>
<p>Pic2</p>
<p>3:get the atoms closer together(increase density)</p>
<p>usually used together</p>
<p>Best shape for the material: sphere, highest efficient shape. But I suppose here is something more profound.</p>

<p>我几乎快要成为一个制作原子弹的专家(相比较于平均认识可以算是比较专业？）了，我现在已经非常清楚它的原理，需要的原料，制作流程，给我足够的原料(最最重要的是铀矿)，人力和机器(很多的离心机)，场地(主要是三个，第一是精炼铀矿的场地，这个要工厂那么大，第二是组装弹头和堆放杂物机器的场地或者实验室，这个不用太大，第三是试爆的场地，这个一定要很大，沙漠，荒漠那种，还有钱，这些东西我全都有的话，我有比较小的概率在两三年内造出来一个</p>

        <p>The market for tourism in remote areas is booming as never before. Countries all across the world are actively promoting their ‘wilderness’ regions - such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and wetlands - to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and also in terms of the proportion of the Earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities, including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year. Tourists are drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now, tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley. ￼ B Once a location is established as a main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside supplies of rice and other foods. In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively short season. However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores. Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the dilemma is always the same: what happens if these new, external sources of income dry up? The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth in adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts, slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or vulnerable to degradation through heavy use. ￼ C Stories about the problems of tourism have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long term. In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of second home developments in the Swiss Pays d’Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production in the area, providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside visitors. Many of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies, who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local people, is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food, walk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers. Native people in the desert regions of the American Southwest have followed similar strategies, encouraging tourists to visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The Acoma and San Ildefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery. Too many people living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their culture and their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely restricting tourism cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people’s desire to see new places will not just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must achieve greater control over tourism ventures in their regions, in order to balance their needs and aspirations with the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that, with firm communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is whether this can become the norm, rather than the exception.</p>

        <p>2023年7月11日</p>
<p>教学计划，学生的词汇量较为薄弱，所以我决定先提升学生的词汇量，学生目前的词汇量在1500左右，我认为至少需要帮她提升2000个词汇。但是两千是一个比较大的数量，所以我想分批来做，先试着讲500到1000个词汇。</p>
<p>此外我不太想使用非常原始的一个一个背的方法，但是如果是独自学习也许会这样记忆，但是因为学生有一个教学能力非常强的辅导，我想挑选一些合适的文章和她一起阅读。我给学生买了笔记本，一本空白，一本线格，一本小本子，也就是从前我背词用的那种，她可以随身携带，用于巩固一些词汇。</p>
<p>2023.7.12.</p>
<p>第二天和他学英语，怎么说，这是一件很奇妙的缘分或者说是事情，暑期的咖啡店兼职期间，开始了每天学习英语的日子，还挺有意思的，感觉自己很久没有这样如此规律的学习过了，难得哈哈。</p>
<p>2023年7月13日</p>
<p>今天已经让学生比较系统的认识了解了整个四级考试试卷的题型和结构。</p>
<p>她现在对作文，听力，阅读，翻译四个大的题型的考察方式，板块时间，有了比较明确的认识。</p>
<p>今天教会了学生使用tiktok，然后介绍指导她在tiktok上学习英语，通过比较有趣的方式。</p>
<p>今天带学生初步比较具体地了解了一个听力的题型，学生的能力比我原先设想的好很多。</p>
<p>接下来需要大量加强学生的词汇，今天和继续介绍了更多的词汇，并且逐渐加强，加大加强学习量。</p>
<p>2023.7.15.</p>
<p>昨天晚上带她去万象城，(The Mix C)吃了一些东西，然后带她滑冰，她说这是她第一次滑冰，我也是。我发现滑冰和我原来想的不太一样，或者说没有我原来想象的那样有趣，虽然也并不是太无聊，但是没有那样极其的有趣，然后是，感觉非常的累，也可能是我还完全不熟悉。另外我发现滑冰鞋的冰刀和我原来想的也不太一样，没有我原来想象的那么锋利，底部是一条有一定宽度（虽然也非常的窄）的片状金属。</p>
<p>我比她熟悉的快一点，所以我滑的快一些，她滑的更慢，有点像在蹒跚学步，有几个瞬间我想搀扶一下她，但是又感觉非常的犹豫，不过最终她没有摔倒，但是有几次似乎看起来险些要摔倒了。</p>
